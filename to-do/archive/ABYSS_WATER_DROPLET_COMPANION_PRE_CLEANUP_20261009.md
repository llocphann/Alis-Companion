> Repository extraction (2026-10-08): implementation and active Companion work now belong to AlisCompanion. The following milestones were imported from Hadalis `b3e05cb4e59cd266a78057fbe4ae95ca679f316f`; historical paths and validation receipts refer to that repository.

# Cloud Bot — Abyss Water Droplet Companion

> **Active Alis-Companion work transferred from Hadalis `dev@4ffc684a4cb2cf89b4f180791974a0e8ca078fad` (2026-10-08).** The sections below are new, OPEN proposals; they were not part of the earlier import pinned at `b3e05cb4e59cd266a78057fbe4ae95ca679f316f`. Product code remains unchanged. See [Hadalis extraction/host contract](../../docs/HADALIS_EXTRACTION.md).

## OPEN P0 — Alis-Companion optimized single-renderer 3D performance study (2026-10-08)

**Pre-implementation design / current decision record:** [Alis-Companion renderer optimization study (2026-10-08)](../../docs/ALIS_COMPANION_RENDERER_OPTIMIZATION_DECISION_20261008.md). This is technical evidence and sequencing beneath this one active TODO, **not** a parallel task list. **BLOCKER G0 / highest priority:** current `aqua-verify-lossless-render.py` can compare source QML but copies the active shader QSB into its baseline; it does not independently certify shader-vs-shader pixel parity. Before optimization, qualify a shader-aware dual-QSB A/B capture with pinned source/binary hashes, identical-source control and deliberately changed-shader negative control. `make test` does not run every historical render/spatial contract automatically. The existing isolated bubble-ray candidate is an E1 *experiment*, not a verified performance improvement. Do not change production renderer until G0 and measurable baseline G1 are satisfied.

**Decision / priority: OPEN RESEARCH, NOT IMPLEMENTED.** Prefer **one existing Qt Quick procedural/implicit-3D renderer with optimized shader paths** over replacing the Aqua/Octo actor with per-animation 2D/2.5D/3D renderers. Do **not** start an adaptive hybrid migration just because 2D sounds cheaper; first prove a real Companion GPU hotspot and compare risk/quality/resource costs. This is the **Alis-Companion-owned active Companion task**. Record reproducible Alis-Companion shader/renderer benchmark findings in this repository's `docs/` (without creating duplicate active task boards); cross-link only **shared/full-shell or host-owned** findings in the [Hadalis canonical optimization audit](https://github.com/llocphann/Hadalis/blob/dev/docs/optimization/STRICT_LOSSLESS_GPU_RAM_CPU_AUDIT.md). Avoid duplicates and retired findings. Preserve all earlier Companion priorities, including the separately OPEN Mochi-inspired laptop/animation plan below.

**G0 tooling status (2026-10-08): REPO-ONLY PREPARATION COMPLETE; LIVE GPU QUALIFICATION STILL OPEN.** [Independent shader A/B harness](../../scripts/aqua-shader-ab.py), [one-command A/A → negative → candidate runner](../../scripts/aqua-shader-ab-sequence.py), [offline capture-contract test](../../scripts/test-aqua-shader-ab-contract.py), [sequence fail-closed test](../../scripts/test-aqua-shader-sequence-contract.py), immutable [E1 bubble source builder](../../scripts/build-aqua-material-candidate.py), and canonical validator registration are committed. The harness verifies distinct source/QSB hashes, backend and queued render frames, rejects nonresponsive captures and stale test receipts, and selects supported `qsb` flags for older/newer Qt. **GitHub Actions PASS on exact Alis-Companion `main@3937c2e369bf403bc9aa4a2a71f8f05641759e5a`:** [run #37815092922](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Companion/actions/runs/37815092922) completed both `offline-contracts` (Python syntax, mocked fail-closed controls, immutable E1 builder) and `compile-shaders` (Qt 6.4.2 `qsb` independently compiles baseline, deliberate-negative and E1 bubble candidate). Earlier CI at `189a04e` identified unsupported older `qsb --qt6`; version-dependent flags were then corrected and retested green. **These CI jobs did not use a real Wayland GPU**, do not demonstrate shader pixel equivalence, do not validate the full Alis-Companion host or establish performance savings. Local chatbot's next task remains G0 live A/A+negative+A/B, followed by G1 before any production shader optimization.

**Repository-only preflight complete (2026-10-09):** [Qt 6 source/QSB portability CI #37815357323](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Companion/actions/runs/37815357323) **PASS** on exact `Alis-Companion main@e0c35447c48333f1ec82e553db7189e91363a036` for baseline, negative-control and bubble-ray variant, plus Octo tentacle and water-contact shader compilation. Source/QSB hashes and independent Python offline checks are in the workflow logs. No production shader, payload, motion or host code was changed. **Still OPEN:** physical Wayland A/A+negative+A/B image proof, Alis-Companion integration validation and G1 baseline GPU/CPU/PSS/VRAM. Later docs-only commits do not retroactively expand the tested source SHA.

**2026-10-09 local G0 evidence / repository follow-up:** Alis-Companion `main@51873887` yielded `INCONCLUSIVE_SELF_CONTROL` (exit 2) at A/A despite exact baseline/candidate source and QSB SHA equality. Neither negative control nor E1 A/B ran; root cause **unconfirmed** because only sequence-level receipt was supplied. Updated [shader A/B harness](../../scripts/aqua-shader-ab.py) to save same-item repeat captures and differentiate unstable readback from cross-instance mismatch without relaxing one-pixel strictness; [sequence summary](../../scripts/aqua-shader-ab-sequence.py) now includes worst-case mismatch metadata. Standalone offline assertions cover this diagnostic; [GitHub CI 37816467318](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Companion/actions/runs/37816467318) passed both jobs on exact `143abcfca0ad07499bb7b83af393d718e4e5de7f`. Control schema **3** makes old A/A controls ineligible. **Local retest OPEN, G1 OPEN; do not implement E1 in production.** [Evidence and interpretation](../../docs/ALIS_COMPANION_RENDERER_OPTIMIZATION_DECISION_20261008.md).

**G1 repository-only preparation (2026-10-09): IMPLEMENTED, NOT HARDWARE-QUALIFIED.** The [read-only, explicitly PID-bound resource sampler](../../scripts/aqua-g1-resource-sample.py) now records source SHAs, process CPU time/one-core percentage, RSS/PSS and thread count, rejects mismatched UID, changed PID identity and dirty source trees, and reports GPU/VRAM/frame pacing as `NOT_MEASURED`. The [cohort comparison script](../../scripts/aqua-g1-compare.py) requires at least three runs per named state with matched backend, role, source SHA and capture protocol; outputs descriptive CPU/RSS/PSS medians and ranges only, with no inferred speedup. [Offline parser tests](../../scripts/test-aqua-g1-resource-contract.py) and [comparison tests](../../scripts/test-aqua-g1-compare-contract.py) are registered with `scripts/validate.py` and the CI workflow. [GitHub Actions #37817648364](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Companion/actions/runs/37817648364) ran both offline contracts plus existing shader build checks **PASS** on Alis-Companion `main@f3ffd11417d442b19b85f8ffdb260f8008dd0f7e`. Local chatbot must still **confirm** OFF/hidden/Aqua/Octo states and collect genuine source-pinned Niri/Wayland GPU/frame-time plus whole-host evidence; no checkboxes for G0/G1 or E1 can be marked complete on CI alone. Runbook lives in [renderer optimization decision](../../docs/ALIS_COMPANION_RENDERER_OPTIMIZATION_DECISION_20261008.md).

### H0 — Pin and profile actual cost before changing behavior/material

- [ ] On fresh Alis-Companion `main` exact SHA and a pinned, compatible Hadalis host `dev` SHA, establish same-hardware, same-driver, same compositor/backend, same DPR/output and same power-policy A/B baselines: disabled vs enabled-but-hidden vs visible idle, walk/run, launch/fall/faceplant (with pitch), and Octo tentacle/grip/pull with Aqua cast handoff; include full-screen/quality/performance/off and prolonged real Niri/Quickshell visits. Sample GPU frame time and p95/p99 frame pacing, CPU time/wakeups, QML allocations/bindings, GPU allocations/texture residency, RSS/PSS and idle power where observable. Report *incremental Companion cost* and *whole-shell cost* separately; GPU utilization % is not GPU time; do not extrapolate CPU/VRAM/FPS savings from shader loop counts or 76x92 logical body area.
- [ ] Capture a reproducible baseline image/pose/motion matrix across Aqua/Octo, 30 Blender-authored actions each, 4 support rims/corners, yaw/pitch/roll, translucency, theme hues, real production `qualityLevel` 0/1 and graphics fallback. Freeze input values and source hashes. Run an identical-source GPU capture control first; existing `scripts/aqua-verify-lossless-render.py` warns that invalid identical-source controls make exact GPU pixel attribution INCONCLUSIVE. Inspect existing `scripts/test-aqua-render-cost-contract.py`, `test-aqua-spatial-volume.py` and `test-companion-cast.py`; add behavior/measurement contracts as needed without weakening the historical controls.

### H1 — Optimize existing 3D shader without losing the liquid appearance

- [ ] **First hotspot to measure:** `modules/abyss/companion/WaterDropletMaterial.frag` `frontInterface()` analytic fast path for effectively zero pitch versus bounded rotated-volume search (production tiers 0/1: 24/32 coarse samples, then seven refinements). Explore invariant/common-subexpression elimination, transformation reuse, tighter *provably conservative* bounds and specialized paths only where equivalent silhouettes/depth/lighting survive. Do not bypass real pitch, flatten the fall or change the accepted center-tip/volume profile.
- [ ] **Second hotspot to measure:** `backInterface()` used for transmission/internal optical paths (production tiers 0/1: 10/18 coarse steps and 3/5 refinements). Prototype exact or rigorously bounded intersections and safe early-outs *behind a baseline comparison*, not by simply reducing steps or disabling refraction/reflectance. Preserve Fresnel, thickness-dependent translucency, normal-dependent optical output, water contact/reflections and near/far occlusion. Tier 2 shader branches exist but current `AquaPreferences.renderTier()` selects only 0/1; do not credit cost of tier 2 in normal production.
- [ ] **Third hotspot to measure:** `OctoTentacle.frag` Bezier/tube intersection, normal and back-interface work during ordinary tentacle motion and Octo grip; test fragment work saved versus any extra CPU/path geometry. Do not trade four spatial opaque tentacles and 16 cups for incorrect flat strokes, change shared grip timing or lose front/back occlusion.
- [ ] Study shader static specialization *only if capture/profiler shows shader variants beat existing uniform-controlled branches*; do not create a variant explosion, live compilation hitch, multiple warm hidden renderers, a second process/window or a separate actor. Retain `WaterDropletBody.qml`'s already implemented tier-0 tiny limb/orbit material and native `76x82` floor-capture ceiling; measure before modifying it. Probe whether eye/cornea, tiny droplets or internal bubbles need optimization without silently reducing effects/quality (tier 1 can evaluate up to 18 internal candidates on relevant branches).
- [ ] Track Hadalis-owned `AbyssField.frag` full-screen/perimeter GPU cost as a **separate, potentially higher-leverage whole-shell investigation** in the [Hadalis canonical optimization audit](https://github.com/llocphann/Hadalis/blob/dev/docs/optimization/STRICT_LOSSLESS_GPU_RAM_CPU_AUDIT.md), not as a Alis-Companion renderer migration. Do not conflate full-screen field cost with Companion 3D cost.

### H2 — Alternative material research only when H1 does not reach measured goal

- [ ] Consider reusable static/procedural light/thickness/normal data or limited 2.5D **material approximation within the same actor and scene graph** as optional candidates. Require equal-or-better CPU/GPU/PSS/VRAM plus visual-approval gates; account for texture sampling, uploads, DPR/color/theme variants and small 76x92 source extent. Never infer that sprite atlases are free or that cached pixel output remains correct through continuous deformation, yaw, pitch, theme and translucency.
- [ ] An adaptive 2D/2.5D/3D **renderer switch** is a last-resort conditional project only after controlled 3D optimization and lite-material A/B trials fail to meet an explicit measured target. Before authorizing it, prove a shared authoritative action clock/pose, shader readiness, bounded switching and fallback without double presentation/input, phase reset, duplicated Qt objects, frame hitches, excessive VRAM/Loader/capture cost, or loss of the same four-rim hit mask. Existing `AquaMotion.qml` changes weight/phase on visibility; do not multiplex independent body instances by toggling `visible`.

### Acceptance, rollback and stop criteria

- [ ] **Preserve** the existing Blender-authored motion curves (30 Aqua + 30 Octo), single Aqua/Octo actor, 5.6-second grip/turn policy, volume-preserving falls, live Abyss color/translucency, eyes/contact/shadow/reflection, four-rim locomotion/portal-distance semantics, cursor/chat/drag/input and software fallback. A strict-lossless optimization requires a *qualified identical-source control and exact/approved visual oracle*; any visually approximate `lite` style is a separately user-approved quality tradeoff, never labeled strict-lossless.
- [ ] Run focused shader, material, cast/volume, four-rim/popup/input, output/DPR/theme, hide/reappear, suspend/hotplug and long-session regressions plus Alis-Companion's `make test HADALIS_ROOT=/path/to/Hadalis` on exact Alis-Companion/host SHAs and the Hadalis host's `bash scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh` when host integration is affected. Preserve render fidelity first; reject optimizations with worse p95/p99, memory, first-frame readiness or material errors even if isolated shader microbenchmarks improve. On regression, revert only the candidate (not working Companion animations); keep the known-good Alis-Companion `main` renderer.
- [ ] **Decision gate:** publish baseline and candidate GPU frame time, whole-shell GPU frame time, CPU, PSS/RSS, VRAM, p95/p99, power where available, image comparison status, actual Niri acceptance and exact source hashes. If original shader cost is negligible, stop and prioritize proven full-screen Abyss optimization rather than engineering a hybrid. No performance percentages or claim of implementation until measured. Docs-only TODO updates do **not** qualify as tests, runtime changes or completed tasks.

**2026-10-09 synthesis checkpoint — SOURCE TOOLING ADVANCED; animation/cowork UI still OPEN.** See [Mochi × Mak1zu × Hadalis design/evidence](../../docs/ALIS_COMPANION_COMPANION_SYNTHESIS_20261009.md), pinned to Mochi `471342631206c40d56bbba016578926e16ca8d0b` and Mak1zu `a30fef7cc10324684fd4ae9123d9c29cbd00ca9e`. Added [pure Behavior Director](../../modules/abyss/companion/AquaBehaviorDirector.js), with [privacy/priority/lifecycle test](../../scripts/test-aqua-behavior-director.cjs), to model coarse terminal/editor focus, concurrent anonymous agent work sessions, 700 ms focus settle, 45 s permission grace, 60 s long-run threshold, 15 min expiry, chat/drag/portal precedence and generation-protected one-shot completion. [Offline CI 37821435311](https://github.com/llocphann/Alis-Companion/actions/runs/37821435311) **PASS** at `7ebb123fb4168f323e28513c74a174878dc71b63`. **Not imported by the live actor, no agent hook or app monitor deployed, no new Blender laptop/3D clip authored.** P0 laptop asset, 3-phase animation, semantic host bridge and Niri/G0/G1 acceptance remain OPEN. Do not enable ambient input observation or call this a shipped feature.

## Open roadmap — Mochi-inspired Alis-Companion behavior and animation expansion (2026-10-08)

**Status: OPEN / planning only; NO runtime code or asset changes in this checkpoint.** “Alis-Companion” is the standalone, optional Companion repository for Hadalis's Aqua/Octo and the retained `aqua` internal IPC/config/history namespace; do not invent a separate character framework or rename stable contracts. This is the **active visual/interaction TODO**. All local model/router/tools/vision decisions still belong exclusively to [AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md](AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md). Preserve the current visual-first/reference approval and native-input/resource gates; new features must not be represented as implemented until exact-source tests and real desktop acceptance qualify them.

**Audited sources (2026-10-08):** Mochi `miflow13/mochi-desktop` `main@471342631206c40d56bbba016578926e16ca8d0b` [manifest](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/assets/mochi/manifest.json), [runtime animation derivation](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/src/mochi/sprites.py), [terminal coworking](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/src/mochi/presence/terminal_cowork.py), [agent tracker](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/src/mochi/agent_activity.py), [AmbiSense](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/docs/ambisense.md), [state-machine audit](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/docs/STATE_MACHINE_AUDIT.md), [Pocket](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/src/mochi/pocket_controller.py), [bond dialogue](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/docs/FR-11_BOND_PHASE_DIALOGUE.md), [Focus](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/docs/FR-12_FOCUS_WITH_MOCHI.md), and [regression watchlist](https://github.com/miflow13/mochi-desktop/blob/main/REGRESSION_WATCHLIST.md). Historical Hadalis baseline (now Alis-Companion-owned runtime): `native/inir-companiond/src/lib.rs`, `modules/abyss/companion/{AbyssCompanion.qml,CompanionBridge.qml,AquaPresence.qml,AquaCuriosity.qml,AquaMotion.qml,AquaMotionData.js,OctoMotionData.js,AquaExpressions.js,AquaPortals.qml}`, `services/AquaMind.qml`; original design evidence remains [in Hadalis](https://github.com/llocphann/Hadalis/blob/dev/docs/AQUA_REFERENCE_DESIGN.md). Current Alis-Companion ownership and host split: [extraction](../../docs/HADALIS_EXTRACTION.md). **Inspiration/behavioral mapping only**: no copied Mochi PNG/spritesheets, character art, GTK/XWayland machinery or blanket source transplant. Any future actual reuse requires license/attribution review and maintainer authorization.

### P0 — Companion laptop/computer interaction (explicit new animation request)

- [ ] **Author a real laptop/mini-computer prop and a complete Aqua/Octo performance**, built in the existing Blender/3D procedural-shader pipeline, NOT static pasted sprites, a second popup/window, fake desktop screenshot or continuously decoded video. The laptop belongs to the single currently visible actor, inherits the Abyss palette and supports hands (Aqua) versus four tentacles (Octo), 3D orientation, contact/reflection, near/far occlusion and small desktop readability. Preserve the round volume, face, two-foot/two-hand Aqua anatomy, Octo's four short tentacles and one-body cast rotation.
- [ ] New semantic authored phases: `laptop_open` (take out/place/open), `laptop_typing_loop` (hands/tentacles keypress with asynchronous glance/blink), `laptop_thinking_loop` (pause typing, look up/at code), `laptop_agent_loop` (observe local coding agent progress without reading its content), `laptop_pause` (subtle idle), `laptop_close` (stop/retract/put away), optionally `laptop_success`/`laptop_error` as short bounded reactions. Use one authoritative sequence owner, legal intro → loop → outro transitions, clean interruption/reentry, and deterministic recovery to current live habitat; *do not* imply laptop was implemented by preexisting `working` expression.
- [ ] Reference **actual Mochi clips**, not a guessed full laptop state machine: `computer` is a 16-frame source animation split in `sprites.py` into `computer_intro` (first four frames), `computer_typing` (middle eight, loop) and `computer_outro` (last four); `terminal_intro/loop/outro`, `agent_intro/loop/outro`, `vs_code`, `typing_intro/loop/outro` and `focus_start/loop/stop` are separate references. Recreate motion in original Aqua/Octo visual language instead of importing pixel animation assets.
- [ ] Event policy: sustained terminal/editor focus or optionally an explicit Companion action may request laptop; anonymous typing *intensity* can modulate keys, not reveal text; Codex/Claude Code lifecycle can switch to agent screen, show a brief `wave` for genuinely unresolved permission waits, and celebrate only meaningful completed runs. Debounce fleeting focus/agent events; release stale sessions; respect quiet/focus mode, hidden/fullscreen/game, user drag/chat/menu/feature ownership and output changes. Coding-agent signals never execute tools, grant permission or expose prompt/command/path/reply.
- [ ] Placement and renderer gates: stand on all four Screen Edge rims and supported existing Abyss bodies, rotate the prop with 0°/180°/±90° support orientation while keeping readable prop content upright where feasible, clamp to *real* free space; never paint over client content, block unrelated input, add persistent texture captures or open detached surfaces. Hide/unmap effects and stop their clocks when actor is absent; preserve distant-portal-only semantics (no portal for routine laptop emergence).
- [ ] Acceptance: deterministic three-phase transitions and focus switching (terminal ↔ editor ↔ agent), repeated start/stop, direct drag mid-loop, early stop during intro, interruption during outro, stale callbacks and reconnect, multiple agent sessions, output switch, 4-rim/corner/surface overlap, mode/quality fallback, theme change, fractional scaling, FPS/CPU/GPU/RAM idle-versus-active measurement. Prove real Niri/Quickshell behavior on exact SHA; test cases must not count a mock prop as physical acceptance.

### P0 — Event awareness and behavior integrity (learn from Mochi without duplicating existing Aqua work)

- [ ] Build on `inir-companiond`'s existing finite semantic `Mood`, `Activity`, `Expression`, personality and event protocol; `AquaPresence` already owns travel, peek, hover reactions, surface support, portal and drag; `AquaCuriosity` already owns popup visits/handoff. **Audit before adding**, extend rather than invent parallel state/popup/input subsystems. A central deterministic priority/arbitration contract must separate *semantic behavior*, *long-lived domain session* (focus/cowork) and *visual performance/one-shot*; interactive chat/drag/security/modal > explicit movement > ambient/context > low-priority idle. One owner per temporary performance, finite TTL and cancellation tokens; never let a superseded completion restart it.
- [ ] Add privacy-reduced **AmbiSense-style** semantic signals through the Hadalis host's narrow, consent-respecting integration contract (host services include `NiriService`, `CompositorService`, `MprisController`, `Battery`, `Network`, `Idle`, `GameMode`, etc.): coarse `editor|terminal|browser|media|files|creative` category, focused/unfocused/idle/lock/suspend/return, media playing/paused, battery/network transitions, anonymous typing bursts when permitted. Avoid keyboard capture, keystrokes, document/browser titles, browser history, URLs, reading window contents, screenshot polling or journaling activity metadata. Detectors report observations; central policy decides if the actor may react. Disabled/unavailable detectors fail silent.
- [ ] Add a narrow **coding-agent lifecycle hook** inspired by Mochi (`working|activity|needs_input|prompt_waiting|finished|ended`, allow-listed messages + opaque hashed per-session identifiers). Prefer a Alis-Companion-owned bounded native tracker or the existing explicitly permitted Hadalis host bridge; never import Mochi's GTK D-Bus UI. Cap concurrent sessions, debounce rapid turns, expire stale state and notification TTL; background hooks must never delay or break Codex/Claude. React only when actual actor is permitted; no inference needed for hook-triggered reflexes.
- [ ] Add a single **quiet/annoyance budget** shared by contextual dialogue, AI check-ins and ambient motion: cooldown per category, global rate limit, deduped event queue with expiry, no surprise focus steals; respect fullscreen, game, modal/security, manual-only, Focus, sleep/lock and reduced-motion/off settings. Restore exactly the prior active context after animation interruption; no endless timer/polling loops.

### P1 — Additional authored animation opportunities (verified in Mochi manifest)

The names below are **Mochi reference clips**, not claims that Alis-Companion already ships them; use source-original Blender action names as appropriate. **Do not recreate existing Aqua/Octo `walk/run/fly/jump/float/drag/peek/dive/launch/fall/balance/reach/inspect/startle/wave` or existing face/semantic expressions unless a distinct observable behavior is missing.**

- [ ] **`reading` (24-frame looping Mochi reference)**: produce/retract a small book/tablet, turn pages, track lines with eyes; could accompany user reading or manual Focus, not continuously inspect text.
- [ ] **`coffee` (21-frame one-shot), `focus_start/loop/stop` (4/24/4) and `focus_thinking_start/loop/end` (5/8/5)**: hold a mug, sip, stretch and return to a quiet laptop/book, with optional subtle coffee steam; tie focus session to existing `TimerService` rather than a competing timer. No food/water requirement or compulsory care loop.
- [ ] **`sleep`, `sleeping`, `wake` (6/3/6)**: gentle drowsy → sleeping loop → wake/stretch; tie to genuine session idle/lock/suspend and explicit user choice with grace/cooldown; avoid waking or auto-speaking over fullscreen and don't treat a momentary lock as a full new visit.
- [ ] **`watch` (8-frame loop), `dance` (8-frame loop)**: look toward media / bounded reactive dance on playback, theme-consistent; follow MPRIS and focus semantics rather than processing audio continuously; respect quiet and reduced motion.
- [ ] **`searching` (20-frame loop)**: curiosity/looking through a small map/magnifier or Abyss drawer on file-browsing context; use content-free app category and existing UI, no filesystem scanning for ambient effect.
- [ ] **`pocket_grab` (8-frame one-shot)**: brief reach/catch/secure gesture when the user intentionally drags file/text/URL/image onto the actual actor. Build a bounded Pocket with persistence-first operations, original-file-safe remove, dedupe, limits and sanitization; use existing Hadalis file/vault UI when possible, and no unsolicited AI ingestion. Verify Wayland drag/drop capability before promising live behavior.
- [ ] **`side_eye` (13 frames), `table_flip` (16), `this_is_fine` (16)**: optional playful humor after safe events (minor failure/retry); avoid blaming the user, interrupting work, triggering on serious system/security incidents or unbounded prop shaders. Keep ephemeral and switchable.
- [ ] **`level_up_default` (16), `heart` (16)**: rare warmth/celebration tied to genuinely qualified Bond progression. Existing `wave`, `delight`/expression/hop should remain the first-choice lightweight equivalents unless new poses add value.
- [ ] Consider `look`, `blink`, `sway_idle`, `bounce`, `squish`, `pickup`, `drop`, `typing_*` as **micro-motion/timing studies**, not automatically new features: Aqua already has many overlapping movements. Adapt gaze delay, per-key irregularity, blink timings, weight shifts and recovery via current curves.
- [ ] Keep `fedora_intro/loop/outro`, `mochi_exe` and Mochi-branded jokes **reference-only / no direct import**; optional Hadalis-native easter eggs need an independent design and opt-in later.

### P1/P2 — Companion utility, identity and extensibility

- [ ] **P1 Pocket UX:** after validated user-initiated drop, offer a compact list to open/save/share into Abyssal Vault or send to local AI only with explicit consent. Persist bounded metadata, never delete original user files and never grant tool/file writes from model text. Reuse existing Abyss popup styling; no separate permanent widget/window.
- [ ] **P1 Bond and personality:** optional local, bounded, non-decaying familiarity stages; short age-appropriate dialogue variants and occasional unlocked idle emotes, based on consensual direct use or intentional Focus rather than surveillance, input-volume farming or coercive rewards. Keep mood (momentary), personality (stable preference) and bond (optional familiarity) independent. Avoid dependent/romantic/possessive copy and guilt for absence. Persistence after restart, no off-by-one double level-ups; no model needed to evaluate progression.
- [ ] **P1 Focus with Companion:** co-work with a laptop, reading or coffee scene while the existing Hadalis focus/timer service runs; interruptions pause only visuals, not elapsed session, and Focus does not monopolize all direct interactions. Suppress ambient chat/agent celebration until eligible.
- [ ] **P2 Animation catalogue/authoring lab:** readable preview of per-character authored Blender clips, emotion/prop/transition metadata, unlocked vs unavailable preview; keep editor tooling separate from production. Contract each clip's entry, bounded loop, outro, four-rim orientation, anchor, intended reaction trigger, fallback and stop behavior; one style for Aqua/Octo but distinct anatomy.
- [ ] **P2 Runtime regression watchlist:** borrow Mochi's recovery-first approach. Test stale callbacks, rapid click/drag, manual hide, laptop intro canceled, close interrupted, hotspot hit region, pointer hand-off, full-screen/modal precedence, theme/quality changes, suspend/resume, hotplug/multi-monitor, restart and orphan/timer absence.

### Sequencing, boundaries and completion gates

1. **Do not start at P1/P2 before preserving existing visual/reference and native-input acceptance.** First audit event routing and write non-visual, deterministic behavior/cancellation tests (P0). Then author **laptop** as the first new observable animation family for **both Aqua and Octo** with source Blender motion curves and an attached lightweight procedural prop.
2. Add coarse desktop context and agent hooks behind opt-in/privacy policy; compare cold/idle resource costs to unchanged baseline. Then add reading/coffee/focus and sleep/wake, media, Pocket, humor, Bond/catalogue in descending value; each new behavior must have its own observed trigger and independent teardown.
3. Keep Alis-Companion's `AquaMind`/shared Hadalis AI transport and on-demand GGUF boundary: local inference is optional, never necessary for procedural movement, never granted raw desktop input; the Rust companion daemon stays deterministic. No second popup framework, no 2nd full-screen capture layer, no continuous video/sprite playback, no broad native pointer region.
4. Each task is **OPEN** until implementation commit, exact-SHA Alis-Companion focused tests and `make test HADALIS_ROOT=/path/to/Hadalis`, affected Hadalis host validation, GPU/frame-clock and CPU/RAM measurements (no unmeasured savings claims), and actual maintainer-observed Niri/Quickshell acceptance on all four rims/supported surfaces with pointer/collision and lifecycle checks. A docs-only commit is not an implemented animation or production PASS. Keep Hadalis `stable` untouched; new Companion work targets Alis-Companion `main`.

Status: **Current cloud UI request complete and deployed; canonical PASS: 389 PASS / 0 FAIL / 2 SKIP on exact source 57c5fca52beca4f24d0c86f596c34c8fcd1cd87d. Prior Aqua/Octo checkpoint below retains its separate source and acceptance limits.**
Current UI request (2026-10-07): the chatbox has an Abyss accent border and curved outlined tail; the two smaller cloud actions have bordered, fully curved contours and an inward-facing orbit around Aqua/Octo for Top/Bottom/Left/Right edges and corners. Icons remain upright and separate node input footprints preserve the space between them. Geometry passes 300 scale/edge/corner cases; actual owned GPU/hover/click checks pass on all four rims, together with existing local speech/helper, sequential Mood/Energy, host policy and shared input contracts. UI source `2f3637148a4f5d005413c8d86a086fd4aaf1971a` is pushed and the four installed UI files match; native fields/backend are ready with one daemon and existing preference values preserved. Canonical source `57c5fca52beca4f24d0c86f596c34c8fcd1cd87d` has the same four UI files and passes 389 checks with zero failures, two deferred checks, Qt 6.11.2 parsing and a clean validation tree. [Four-edge/chat evidence](../../docs/aqua-visual/cloud-orbit-20261007/README.md) and [exact validation](../../docs/aqua-visual/cloud-orbit-20261007/validation.json) retain source identities. Native physical input, multi-output/lifecycle, reference approval and whole-session resource acceptance remain separate.
Cast checkpoint (2026-10-07): rename the live droplet to Aqua; add a Blender-authored Octo with four short, plump, nearly opaque tentacles, 16 cups and a larger round head. Both editable rigs have 30 actions and follow Abyss colors/reflections. Latest steering requires only one body at a time: Octo sinks into quicksand; hidden Octo tentacles rise behind/in front of Aqua, coil around it and pull it underwater. Both exits last 5600 ms. The successor emerges at the exact outgoing placement only after presentation reaches zero; no incoming head/body or extra input region is instantiated. Aqua has no quicksand clip. English Settings select Aqua/Octo and optionally take turns. Source `f0e70dd98ae8d6bcf0a6cc49b41b2aa003578c24` is pushed and deployed through 11 guarded runtime files; native IPC observes both directions and one daemon, with existing preferences preserved. Four-rim/same-opening/one-body/grip/cancellation and actual GPU opacity/reflection/fall checks pass. Canonical on that exact SHA remains FAIL: 367 PASS / 16 FAIL / 2 SKIP; failed identities overlap the preceding 0c804b5ac run, without establishing causality. [Current evidence](../../docs/aqua-visual/cast-20261007/README.md) and [exact validation](../../docs/aqua-visual/cast-20261007/validation.json) separate this checkpoint from later dev commits, physical input/multi-output/lifecycle and resource/reference acceptance. Preserve the aqua IPC/config/history namespace. AI status remains in the canonical plan below.

Current maintainer direction (2026-10-04): use actual 3D pitch/yaw/roll of the round liquid volume, retaining the centered tip, exactly two feet/two hands, orbital bubbles, themed optical reflection and slight translucency. Falls must not flatten a 2D torso. Stand/walk on the four oriented water rims and registered Abyss bodies; walk16/run32/fly105 remains. Entrances jump/launch higher, include backside landing and stuck pushes; exits include slower 5.6-second quicksand, fall-vanish and icy retry. A normal deadline cannot remove Aqua until eight seconds after full reveal. Float-up offers are reduced to 3%, while supported walking and transit flight remain. Growing popups/waves still carry/balance the actor. Curiosity borrows the mature popup without duplicates, closes only its own departed visit and remains default-on/occasional for Modules, Sidebars, Quicknotes and Notifications. Settings/Dashboard/Dock are excluded from autonomous opening; user-opened Dock/Settings remain habitats. English settings and default-off for fresh installations remain. [Current design](../../docs/AQUA_REFERENCE_DESIGN.md) and [spatial evidence](../../docs/aqua-visual/spatial-20261004/README.md) retain validation boundaries.
AI planning/status: use only the [canonical Aqua Local AI plan](AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md). This visual task records the minimal English speech presentation: one Mood row, then one Energy row; no check-in prompt input; Super + Alt + Comma opens explicit chat. It does not duplicate model/runtime decisions or AI qualification.
Workflow: single-agent development on dev; repository regressions and the canonical maintainer validator provide acceptance.
Previous shared-water checkpoint: runtime and exact canonical tested source `901e98864157211dd8a857e320efc5c1ac041d20`, after shared-water feature `16e6122951f17753341c9db0dc49b707837de6ef`, painted-capacity guard `eb47aa88d` and historical/click repair `2f01fbadf`. Canonical result: **372 PASS / 40 FAIL / 2 SKIP**, all **79 Aqua Python regressions PASS**, Qt 6.11.2 parser PASS and clean validator tree. All forty failed identities overlap the prior presence report; no identities are added or removed. Overlap is not causal attribution; repo-wide status remains FAIL. Actual owned-window tests cover seven registered body kinds, supported body walking, nearest body-water dive, finite settle, parent waves and effects/motion/policy/capacity hide; 244 scene contacts and 32 actual Quickshell Region activation cases pass. The same complete-host input footprint is reused on ordinary and Utility masks, with modal/Overview precedence retained. Dock holds open through visits/arrival/dive. Frozen own-field GPU controls prove visible local deformation and zero RGBA differences after restoration; they do not establish old/new shader or full-character parity, native input, resemblance percentage or resource savings. Original field dependencies are archived byte-for-byte for their consumed historical fake-only proof; original hashes/helpers/receipts remain unchanged. [Shared-water evidence](../../docs/aqua-visual/abyss-water-20261004/README.md) and [exact validation](../../docs/aqua-visual/abyss-water-20261004/validation.json) retain source, artifact and log identities. Next qualify native shared-surface paint and physical input, multi-output/lifecycle and whole-session resources; AI stays deferred and production default-off.

Previous presence checkpoint: runtime source `5def317ddc6f934c9cb0730085030fa6e02d73e3`, after feature `79490997ee146a6ef2428ce1abe45e53683ec071`; preview tooling and exact canonical tested source `e9c032bdde3fe7e9952cb3964d732b1fa73d862d`, with production bytes unchanged by that tooling commit. Canonical result: **370 PASS / 40 FAIL / 2 SKIP**, all **77 Aqua Python regressions PASS** and Qt 6.11.2 parser PASS. Thirty-nine failed-check identities overlap the previous report; the additional failure is anti-flashbang content sampling. Identity overlap is not causal attribution; repo-wide status remains FAIL. Focused source/owned-window interaction checks pass, including peek/retraction, hover interruption, direction-aware gaze, walk/flight, drag, reached water-edge dive, hidden clocks and a sustained-popup visit. The saved Blender scene retains 174 exported keys across six actions; 3,030 actual Blender evaluations agree within float32 rounding. GPU single-image gallery/peek and English settings persistence are separate from the successful software motion export. Default GPU frame export timed out and remains incomplete; no GPU frame pacing, pixel-parity or resource improvement is claimed. [Source-pinned results](../../docs/aqua-visual/presence-20261004/validation.json) retain the exact test SHA and private-log digest. Next qualify native four-edge/Sidebar/Popup paint and physical input, capture pacing, multi-output/lifecycle and whole-session resources.

Previous checkpoint: runtime source `99cd39d2cfad20fab3ce9abc0a7dcac9ab44a459`; focused test repair and canonical tested source `bea5a3b3880e03b5d081fca3a4df5630bb11aa71`, with runtime bytes unchanged. Qt 6 canonical result: **370 PASS / 39 FAIL / 2 SKIP**, all **76 Aqua Python regressions PASS**. Thirty-eight failed-check identities match the previous report; the additional desktop-repair failure is the exact-SHA detached checkout conflicting with that diagnostic's `dev` requirement. The repo-wide status is still FAIL. Eighteen Rust tests and all-target clippy pass. [New source-pinned evidence](../../docs/aqua-visual/locomotion-20261003/README.md) includes the saved Blender rig and every exported key, 1,818 actual Blender evaluation samples, safe complete walking paths, GPU three-tier two-foot/two-hand checks, a 180-frame actual host capture proving travel/emergence/orbital depth/frozen hidden clocks, and a short owned release-daemon wander/quiet-hide proof. Exact curve export is verified; strict full-image GPU pixel parity remains inconclusive because identical-source controls also differ, including one renderer per process with pointer input disabled. Do not weaken the zero-difference threshold or turn unchanged source budgets into CPU/GPU/FPS claims. Next qualify the capture path before claiming full-image lossless parity, then fresh native panel/popup/input and whole-session resource acceptance; retain production default-off and do not replay historical pointer jobs.
Target shell family: **Abyss first**.  
Primary constraint from maintainer: **do not implement this as a static image mascot. The Water Droplet Companion must be a genuinely animated, continuously alive runtime companion. Prefer Rust for the continuously running backend.**

## Spatial motion and compact sequential speech — 2026-10-04

Runtime source `8b2a0067ed1612770121d8896f46aa5b6db2216d` is pushed and deployed through nine precondition-checked runtime files over the earlier `fa84b0e20` installation; user config remains byte-identical during this upgrade. The native backend is ready, one companion daemon is present, and the actual output/field/scene/actor are valid. The explicit chat IPC toggled twice successfully; this is separate from physical hotkey acceptance.

The reopened Blender scene has **29 actions, 1,332 exact keys, two hands/two feet/eight bubbles**. All limbs share the body parent; 174 evaluated spatial matrices agree within `5.96e-08`, with volume determinant error at most `1.20e-07`. Runtime rotates the implicit 3D liquid before ray intersection/refraction/lighting, projects face/limbs/bubbles from that pose and retains depth under deformation. Owned real-GPU checks keep standing/backside/faceplant/ice projected areas `[48184,47029,48723,49960]` pixels and validate actual face projection, without using flat squash as a fall. The authored scene remains editable; runtime reads exact scalar curves and never loads Blender/mesh/video assets.

Higher RiseJump/Launch arcs are about 83/108 native pixels, with distinct seated landing. Sink lasts 5,600 ms and its shared-field depression/ripple lasts 5,800 ms; FallVanish and icy backside retry add varied exits. The minimum full visit is 8,000 ms; deliberate peek-only and policy hide remain separate. Unsupported float-up offers are 3%. Focused motion, presence, water, four-rim input/gaze, carry/balance, nearby reactions, curiosity ownership, strict QML and shader-package checks pass. The [61-frame GPU motion board and separate Mood/Energy/chat captures](../../docs/aqua-visual/spatial-20261004/README.md) use only owned items and private fixture settings.

Canonical validation is **PASS on exactly `8b2a0067ed1612770121d8896f46aa5b6db2216d`: 418 checks / zero failures / eleven skips**, including all 89 Aqua Python checks, Qt 6.11.2 parser and a clean validator source tree. [Exact receipt](../../docs/aqua-visual/spatial-20261004/validation.json) keeps this source distinct from the subsequent evidence/documentation publication. Native physical input/multi-output/hotplug/suspend/scaling, whole-session resources and concept approval remain open. The original concept is visually compared; its city lighting and optical detail are not matched 100%.

## Enabled visibility recovery — 2026-10-04

Maintainer-reported absent Aqua fixed at `dd7f56ef699b5463dba7580c8ba59b540b6e0742`: hidden Bar/tray modules with span zero had invalidated the entire collision scene. Ignore their empty painted rectangles while retaining record validation and all positive-area collisions. The user's already-enabled Companion is now visibly present on the real `eDP-1` output; both locally installed fix files match the commit. Added bounded, read-only `aqua status` IPC and a real Qt emergence/invalid-geometry/recovery regression. Focused presence, water and input contracts pass. Initial exact-fix canonical validation ended 369 PASS / 45 FAIL / 2 SKIP, including all 80 Aqua regressions; IPC metadata and two fixture-ID collisions were subsequently repaired. [Visibility evidence](../../docs/aqua-visual/visibility-20261004.md) keeps this live paint observation distinct from remaining native interaction, multi-output/lifecycle, concept matching and resource acceptance. Default-off and deferred AI design are retained.

## Lively motion and curious feature visits — 2026-10-04

Historical feature source `3ce40c2380b2bc7e8fc1917a151ca07ab9f226cb`, with keyboard-focus repair `d57e59f1a`. Sixteen Blender actions retain 485 exact keys in 10,885 bytes; 9,999 Blender evaluations and the reopened saved scene pass, with original six actions unchanged. Owned QML checks cover run/jump/fly, accelerated fall, re-grab/takeoff, immediate motion-off, feature gestures, owned close, user hand-off and policy cancellation. 6,306 geometric sweep/landing cases, 32 production adapter cases and six focus cases pass. The English exploration switch persists and old configs receive the requested default. A 26-frame owned GPU board is [viewable here](../../docs/aqua-visual/lively-20261004/aqua-actions.gif). Exact canonical source `8c0cbb2525e7a341bba56854145200adbbabb751`, after the focus fix and duplicate English-key repair, passed **409 checks / zero failures / eleven skips**, including all 82 Aqua Python checks, Qt 6.11.2 parser and a clean validator tree. [Final historical validation](../../docs/aqua-visual/lively-20261004/final-validation.json) does not certify a later source. Physical input on every native feature, multi-output/lifecycle, full-character pixel parity, reference approval and whole-session resource measurements remained open; AI was deferred at this checkpoint and resumed below.

## Historical living-water reactions and local conversations — 2026-10-04

Runtime source `6921fc9943c9412e44936461136753173e1133c5`, after mature-popup repair `d2bc38763` and Blender/reactivity feature `2dfaa00ad`, is deployed through 25 precondition-checked runtime files. Aqua is visible on the real `eDP-1` output after reload, with valid field/scene/actor gates and one native companion daemon; no Aqua startup errors were observed. Existing Companion preferences, including the user's explicit exploration-off value, are preserved. Occasional idle check-ins and read-only shared Obsidian/Abyssal context are enabled. No local provider/model is installed; AI inference remains off. Automatic talk clouds never take focus, and built-in text is labeled honestly.

Twenty-seven reopened Blender actions retain 1,141 exact keys in 25,382 bytes; 22,119 Blender evaluations pass within float32 rounding. Owned QML/JS checks cover all four oriented rims and face/gaze, walk16/run32/fly105, popup carry and water-wave balance/fall, nearby-click/shaking disturbance, temporary breaks, peek-only, icy retry, mature popup/content/slot handoff, local-only HTTP and cancellation/read-only vault contracts. [Current evidence](../../docs/aqua-visual/alive-20261004/README.md) includes a 45-frame GPU action board, English AI settings and speech/editor images. These images are only owned items with private config; they are not desktop captures or resource benchmarks.

Initial canonical source `6921fc9943c9412e44936461136753173e1133c5` remains **FAIL: 410 PASS / three FAIL / eleven SKIP**. Test-only repair `968e10961c2d4734721b05dc43529535c5b15230` removes stale upright=0 constraints and awaits exposed-window/actual-hover conditions without changing production bytes. Its exact canonical result is **PASS: 413 checks / zero failures / eleven skips**, including all 86 Aqua Python checks, Qt 6.11.2 parser and a clean validator tree. That result does not certify the subsequent UI source. Native global pointer sampling remains limited to Aqua/existing Abyss surfaces, and native physical input/multi-output/lifecycle, whole-session resources, actual local-model inference and concept acceptance remain open. No 100% resemblance or lossless full-image/resource claim.

Latest runtime source `77dbd3ad0f21cb6177225989d4cd7e3128c32e15` adds a scene-coordinate guard so speech controls do not count as nearby disturbance. The guard's two runtime files are precondition-checked and deployed. UI source/captures `29e88b9b02e2d5a90fd69eb12461bd2c3f93118a`, after simplification `1501ebffc`, were deployed via five files with no user-config writes. Talk clouds show only the message until hover; no title, border, placeholder, descriptions or text action labels. Hover exposes independent Obsidian-style Mood/Energy buttons and a blank input with icons; explicit input can focus, leaving releases focus and retains the draft, and Aqua pauses travel during interaction. The source icon/accessibility label preserves offline honesty. Reference vault and AI guidance are removed from Settings; existing configured fallback context remains internal/read-only. Current live readback shows exploration enabled, occasional check-ins, Obsidian enabled, AI off/no model, one native companion daemon and a visible valid actor. Owned Qt tests verify actual hover, no hover focus, icon send, choice selection, retained draft, removed control and inside/outside click gating; GPU captures verify the presentation with private config. The superseded UI canonical run stopped at 357 completed checks without completed failures and remains INTERRUPTED / NOT COMPLETE. The canonical run on exact source `77dbd3ad0f21cb6177225989d4cd7e3128c32e15` completed **FAIL: 414 PASS / one FAIL / eleven SKIP**; the mature-popup fixture lost synthetic hover during a fixed idle wait. Its failure is retained in [the pre-proximity receipt](../../docs/aqua-visual/alive-20261004/pre-proximity-validation.json), not relabeled as a pass.

## Historical nearby awareness and departed feature visits — 2026-10-04

Runtime source `6bd6cbdcfe79637c87d0e4577753a53566abadaa` is pushed and deployed through four precondition-checked runtime files, without a user-config write. The real output is visibly active, the backend/scene are ready and one native daemon is running. The latest live configuration has exploration and local AI enabled, occasional check-ins, and no model name configured; it is preserved as found. Model/runtime work is tracked only in the canonical AI plan.

Nearby click distance rises from 190 to 460 scaled pixels; idle gaze and passive recognition reach 420. A single 650–1,149 ms notice deadline may trigger Wave/Inspect/Startle without a click, with a 12–25 second cooldown and personality chance. Passive presence does not count toward annoyance. Chat/working/movement, directed visits, anger, leave/hide and motion/interaction disable gate or cancel it. All four painted Screen Edges receive samples through thin perimeter-width strips; existing Abyss input surfaces remain available, and the interior desktop is not captured.

Once Aqua reaches a feature, leaving beyond a 140-pixel scaled gap closes only its still-owned popup. An external departure cannot be overridden by the old hold/return timer and continues after closure. Clicking/dragging Aqua or using speech closes an unclaimed visit; actual feature hover revokes ownership. Sidebars handed to hover become transient instead of sticky; Utilities retains its existing idle-close path after the Aqua visit hold ends. Modules/Quicknotes/Notifications still use their existing mature content/slot.

Focused real QML checks pass for a non-click pointer approach at 350 px, cooldown/leave/chat cancellation, wider click thresholds, distance-triggered close with continued departure, mature hover/one slot, Utilities visit hold/idle close, 38 adapter ownership cases and 32 real Region activation cases across four painted strips. English button speech/editor and network/sidebar/multi-popup regressions also pass. The full canonical run on exactly `6bd6cbdcfe79637c87d0e4577753a53566abadaa` completed **PASS: 415 checks / zero failures / eleven skips**; its receipt is retained in the historical proximity evidence. Native physical input/multi-output/lifecycle, concept approval and whole-session resource measurements remain distinct from these local results.

## Product goal

Build a small water-droplet companion that belongs visually and behaviorally to the Abyss panel family. It should feel like part of the same deep-water material system rather than a PNG/GIF pasted onto the shell.

The companion must remain lightweight enough to live for the entire desktop session. Its personality comes from motion, gaze, squash/stretch, surface tension, specular movement, ripples and reactions to shell/system events. It must not depend on continuous AI inference, network access or a high-frequency scripting loop.

## Current-repo constraints observed before planning

- Hadalis production native helpers already live in the Rust workspace under `native/`; Rust is the production backend and Python is a rollback path for migrated helpers.
- Abyss already owns a procedural/material vocabulary through `modules/abyss/looks/AbyssStyle.qml`, `AbyssField.qml` and `AbyssField.frag(.qsb)`: deep surface, raised surface, electric accent, specular highlight, glow, blur/refraction controls and motion gating.
- The existing mascot settings path is pose/manifest based and can resolve PNG/GIF artwork. That architecture may remain for the existing mascot and other panel families, but the Water Droplet implementation must **not** reuse the static pose-file rendering model.
- `Appearance.animationsEnabled`, effects gates, Game Mode and performance settings already exist and must remain authoritative.
- Quickshell already supports long-lived `Process` consumers and stdin-enabled process interaction patterns, so a low-frequency/event-driven Rust bridge can be investigated before introducing a new heavyweight IPC stack.

## Non-negotiable implementation rules

- [ ] **No static Water Droplet art pack.** Do not implement the character as PNG, GIF, WebP animation, sprite sheet, APNG, video, Lottie export, pre-rendered frame atlas or a collection of pose images.
- [ ] The droplet body and face are runtime-rendered from primitives/procedural geometry/shaders.
- [ ] Rust owns long-lived behavior/state/scheduling where that materially reduces wakeups, allocations or QML/JS timer work.
- [ ] Do **not** move GPU drawing into Rust merely because Rust is preferred. Qt Quick/QML/ShaderEffect should remain the renderer when it is the lowest-overhead path; Rust should feed compact state/parameters rather than pixels.
- [ ] No 60 Hz IPC stream. QML interpolates visual motion locally; Rust emits state changes and low-rate physics targets/events.
- [ ] No busy loop while hidden or idle.
- [ ] Hidden companion must approach zero render work and near-zero backend wakeups except scheduled/event-driven work.
- [ ] Respect `Appearance.animationsEnabled`, reduced-motion, effects settings, Game Mode/fullscreen policy, battery policy and suspend/resume.
- [ ] No continuous LLM/personality inference. Personality is a deterministic/local state machine. Planned AI conversation and opted-in event commentary default to a local model and stay outside the core animation loop; no automatic cloud fallback.
- [ ] Multi-monitor behavior, shell reloads, suspend/resume and compositor restarts must not leave orphan processes or duplicate companions.
- [ ] Existing Kira/static mascot behavior must not be deleted as part of the first Abyss implementation. Migrate only after live acceptance proves the new companion can replace the required surfaces.

## Proposed architecture

### 1. Rust runtime: `inir-companiond`

Preferred direction: add a small dedicated workspace member such as `native/inir-companiond/` rather than putting a perpetual companion loop into an unrelated helper.

Responsibilities:

- own the companion state machine;
- aggregate low-frequency system/shell events;
- schedule blink, micro-expression, idle curiosity, sleep and reaction windows;
- maintain deterministic spring targets/behavior parameters;
- select reaction intent without choosing rendered frames;
- maintain per-monitor placement intent and visibility policy;
- persist only durable user settings/state that actually needs persistence;
- expose health/version/protocol information;
- sleep on event sources/timers instead of polling;
- survive normal shell UI recreation without resetting personality every time, if lifecycle testing shows that is desirable;
- exit cleanly when the Hadalis session ends and never multiply on shell reload.

Rust should **not** render the droplet, rasterize frames or send images to QML.

Candidate state model:

`Dormant -> Idle -> Curious -> Engage -> React -> Settle`

with orthogonal dimensions instead of an explosion of hard-coded poses:

- visibility: hidden / peeking / present;
- attention: neutral / pointer / active-surface / notification / media / task;
- mood: calm / happy / curious / focused / sleepy / concerned;
- activity: idle / thinking / working / success / warning / error;
- motion energy: 0..1;
- gaze target: normalized x/y or semantic target;
- body targets: squash, stretch, lean, tip bend, bob, ripple strength;
- face targets: blink, eye openness, pupil offset, mouth curve;
- accent/event pulse.

This produces many combinations without storing pose artwork.

### 2. Bridge/protocol

First candidate: one long-lived Rust child process owned by a QML service/bridge, using newline-delimited compact JSON or another existing native protocol pattern over stdio.

Requirements:

- event/state messages only, not per-frame updates;
- bounded messages;
- schema version field;
- monotonic sequence number;
- QML can send semantic events such as hover/click/surface-open instead of raw mouse samples when possible;
- process restart with exponential backoff and duplicate-process protection;
- no disk-file polling for animation state;
- no shelling out once per animation/event.

Before implementation, audit whether extending `inir-protocol` or another existing native transport gives lower lifecycle complexity. Do not introduce D-Bus/socket infrastructure solely for this feature unless the stdio bridge cannot meet lifecycle or bidirectional requirements.

### 3. QML procedural renderer

Proposed location: `modules/abyss/companion/`.

Potential components:

- `AbyssCompanion.qml` — public host and placement/input contract;
- `CompanionBridge.qml` — Rust process/protocol bridge;
- `WaterDropletBody.qml` — procedural body;
- `WaterDropletFace.qml` — eyes/pupils/mouth/highlights;
- `WaterDropletRipple.qml` — contact ripple/ground response;
- `WaterDropletMotion.qml` — local interpolation/springs from Rust targets;
- one compact fragment shader if SDF/refraction/specular quality materially beats pure Shapes.

Rendering direction:

- one droplet silhouette derived from an SDF, Shape path, or similarly cheap procedural representation;
- surface color comes from Abyss tokens rather than hard-coded mascot blues;
- reuse `AbyssStyle.surfaceDeep`, `surfaceRaised`, `accent`, `specular`, `glow`, effects gates and wallpaper/material context where practical;
- specular highlight and internal caustic-like movement are procedural and slowly animated;
- face geometry is vector/procedural, not texture artwork;
- contact shadow/ripple uses at most one cheap procedural pass;
- avoid an extra full-screen wallpaper capture/FBO just for the companion;
- avoid particle systems for normal idle behavior. Small secondary droplets should be generated sparingly and bounded if retained at all.

### 4. Conversation boundary

The existing prototype uses the connected output window for English talk clouds and explicit chat, button-based Mood/Energy check-ins, read-only Obsidian context, bounded session history/cancellation and expiring expression intents through the single bridge. See the [shipped prototype behavior](../../docs/AQUA_REFERENCE_DESIGN.md#existing-conversation-prototype--local-llm-by-default).

All future AI planning/status, provider/runtime/model decisions and qualification belong only to the [canonical Aqua Local AI plan](AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md). Model work must leave the deterministic visual engine responsive and must not download/start a model merely because Settings opens.

## Animation language — “alive”, not looping artwork

The base idle animation must never look like a GIF loop. Use layered motions with different periods plus event-driven interruption:

- slow surface-tension breathing;
- tiny vertical bob;
- tip sway/bend;
- asymmetric squash/stretch with spring settling;
- eye blink with non-uniform intervals;
- gaze drift toward pointer/active content;
- pupil catchlight motion;
- slow specular/caustic drift across the body;
- subtle base ripple after movement;
- reaction pulse when a task/notification/system event arrives;
- settle animation after every stronger reaction;
- sleep behavior after prolonged inactivity;
- wake behavior on meaningful activity.

All motion should be parameterized so reduced-motion can lower amplitude/rate without substituting pre-rendered art. When animations are fully disabled, the renderer may hold a procedural still state; it must still not fall back to a static image asset.

## Interaction model

Initial safe scope:

- hover: eyes/gaze follow within a bounded region;
- click/tap: short squash + ripple + happy/curious response;
- optional drag: reposition only when explicitly enabled/editing, not normal accidental pointer movement;
- panel/surface events: glance or lean toward the active surface;
- task completion: brief success reaction;
- warning/error: concerned expression without distracting full-screen motion;
- media activity: subtle rhythm response only if a cheap existing signal is available; do not run another audio analyzer;
- idle: autonomous micro-behavior;
- fullscreen/Game Mode: hide or enter minimal mode according to existing policy.

The companion must never randomly rearrange user UI by default.

## Abyss placement

First integration should be a **panel-sitter / edge companion**, because it can visually share the Abyss perimeter without creating another independent floating-window design language.

Placement requirements:

- obey current output ownership;
- understand top/bottom/left/right Abyss edges;
- use existing Abyss geometry/placement helpers rather than inventing another screen coordinate system;
- do not block Screen Edge hover transfer or connected popup hit testing;
- input region should be limited to the actual companion bounds;
- preserve nearby-corner and popup clearance;
- hide/reflow when the available edge segment becomes too small;
- scale correctly at fractional display scale.

Later, the same procedural renderer may be embedded in Dashboard/empty states/AI surfaces, but do not duplicate independent animation engines per surface.

## Runtime/performance strategy

The companion is expected to exist for the whole desktop session, so performance is a release gate.

### Backend

- event-driven Rust; no fixed-rate busy loop;
- use monotonic timers;
- coalesce bursts of events;
- bounded queue;
- deterministic PRNG seed/state for idle scheduling where useful;
- no heap churn in the hot idle path;
- no filesystem polling;
- no subprocess spawn per event;
- hidden/quiet state should wake only for the next scheduled semantic action or an external event.

### Renderer

Use adaptive visual cadence:

- hidden: no animation frame work;
- visible calm idle: target ~24–30 fps only if the procedural effect actually needs continuous frames;
- direct interaction/strong transition: allow display-rate animation temporarily;
- battery/reduced-motion: lower motion amplitude and cadence;
- Rust target updates should usually be much lower frequency than render frames; QML interpolates locally.

Do not enforce these numbers blindly. Measure actual frame pacing and lower cadence further if visual quality is unchanged.

### Initial qualification budgets

These are **targets to measure**, not claims about current performance:

- idle hidden companion: effectively zero GPU animation work;
- Rust daemon idle CPU should be close to scheduler noise on maintainer hardware;
- no sustained wakeup loop when nothing changes;
- visible idle should not create measurable shell jank or missed frames during popup/sidebar animation;
- memory must remain bounded across 8+ hour runtime, repeated show/hide, shell reload and monitor changes;
- no growing QML object count, message queue or Rust allocation trend.

Record baseline and after-implementation measurements before setting a hard percentage threshold.

## Configuration/settings plan

Abyss settings should expose only useful controls:

- Enable Water Droplet Companion;
- size/scale;
- automatic visits across clear screen edges and existing surfaces, with no fixed placement controls;
- interaction level;
- reaction intensity;
- idle personality intensity;
- follow-pointer/gaze toggle;
- battery saver behavior;
- event reaction toggles;
- reduced-motion behavior;
- debug overlay only in developer/debug mode.

Do not expose dozens of animation constants to normal users. Keep tuning values internal or grouped under Advanced.

The page has Overview, Behavior, Rendering and **AI**. Size is in Rendering; fixed placement controls are removed. The existing AI prototype has English controls for Talk clouds, Check-ins and reminders, Enable local AI, Local endpoint, Installed model name, Test connection, Clear conversation and Connect Obsidian. Reference vault and AI guidance text are removed. Rendering presets remain independent of model limits. Further AI settings/runtime work is tracked only in [AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md](AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md).

## Existing mascot migration policy

The current mascot system can remain intact during development.

For Abyss Water Droplet:

- do not load `assets/images/mascot/manifest.json`;
- do not resolve `inir-mascot-*.png` or `*.gif`;
- do not model reactions as a filename switch;
- do not require the optional mascot art pack.

After live acceptance, decide whether:

1. Abyss uses Water Droplet while ii/Waffle keep Kira; or
2. the procedural companion becomes the common companion engine with family-specific skins.

Do not make that migration decision before runtime/performance acceptance.

## Implementation phases

### Phase 0 — audit and contract

- [ ] Re-audit latest `dev` before implementation.
- [ ] Map every existing mascot host, command, setting and event source.
- [ ] Map Abyss placement/hit-test ownership and identify the safest panel-sitter host.
- [ ] Audit Quickshell long-lived Process stdin/stdout semantics and shutdown behavior.
- [ ] Decide whether `inir-companiond` is standalone or part of an existing native binary.
- [ ] Write a small versioned protocol contract before UI implementation.
- [ ] Establish CPU/RSS/wakeup/frame-time baseline with companion disabled.

### Phase 1 — Rust core

- [ ] Add Rust crate/workspace wiring.
- [ ] Implement typed state machine and semantic event model.
- [ ] Implement monotonic scheduling and idle sleep.
- [ ] Implement bounded event coalescing.
- [ ] Implement deterministic unit tests for transitions/timers.
- [ ] Implement protocol parser/serializer and malformed-input handling.
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown/restart/duplicate-instance policy.
- [ ] Add structured diagnostics suitable for local validation.

### Phase 2 — procedural renderer

- [ ] Implement droplet silhouette without image textures.
- [ ] Implement face/gaze/blink procedurally.
- [ ] Implement spring squash/stretch/lean/tip motion.
- [ ] Implement specular/caustic drift using Abyss colors.
- [ ] Implement contact ripple.
- [ ] Implement local interpolation so protocol is not frame-rate coupled.
- [ ] Gate shader/effects by existing performance/effects policy.
- [ ] Prove hidden state stops continuous rendering.

### Phase 3 — Abyss integration

- [ ] Add one canonical Abyss companion host.
- [ ] Integrate edge/output geometry.
- [ ] Integrate hover/click without stealing unrelated panel input.
- [ ] Integrate panel-open/notification/task/media/system semantic events.
- [ ] Add Game Mode/fullscreen/suspend behavior.
- [ ] Add settings and safe defaults.
- [ ] Ensure shell reload does not create duplicate daemon instances.

### Phase 4 — optimization

- [ ] Profile backend CPU, wakeups and RSS.
- [ ] Profile QML scene graph/frame timing/GPU effects.
- [ ] Remove unnecessary timers and bindings.
- [ ] Ensure no 60 Hz backend-to-QML state traffic.
- [ ] Ensure no image decode/cache path is used for the Water Droplet.
- [ ] Tune animation cadence separately for idle/interacting/battery/reduced-motion.
- [ ] Stress 8+ hour runtime and repeated state changes for leaks.

### Phase 5 — validation

- [ ] Add contract test that Water Droplet runtime does not reference static pose image formats or mascot manifest paths.
- [ ] Add Rust unit/integration tests.
- [ ] Add lifecycle test for one daemon only across shell restart/reload.
- [ ] Run `bash scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh` on the exact SHA.
- [ ] Live Niri test: primary + secondary monitor, fractional scaling, edge changes, fullscreen, Game Mode.
- [ ] Live suspend/resume.
- [ ] Live popup/sidebar hover-transfer test with companion present.
- [ ] Record visual acceptance for idle, hover, click, working, success, warning/error, sleep/wake.
- [ ] Compare disabled vs enabled CPU/RSS/frame-time before closing the task.

### AI boundary — canonical plan

All future local-AI planning, runtime/model decisions, qualification status and benchmark summaries belong only to [AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md](AQUA_LOCAL_AI.md). The initial loopback conversation prototype, English AI controls, read-only context, bounded history/cancellation and typed expressions are implemented behavior recorded by this visual task's historical evidence. Their controlled-provider tests do not qualify an actual production model or replace the canonical AI plan.

## Local Bot deterministic validation jobs to prepare later

Do **not** dispatch these until implementation exists and a SHA is pinned:

- build the Rust workspace in release mode;
- run companion Rust tests;
- run protocol/lifecycle contract tests;
- run the static-art prohibition contract;
- collect bounded process CPU/RSS/wakeup diagnostics;
- collect bounded Quickshell logs;
- run canonical maintainer validation.

Cloud Bot remains responsible for interpreting evidence, diagnosing failures and deciding changes.

## Acceptance definition

This task is complete only when all of the following are true:

- Water Droplet is rendered procedurally and has no PNG/GIF/sprite/video pose dependency.
- It visibly behaves as a living character through layered non-loop-like motion and reactions.
- Rust owns the long-lived state/scheduling backend and sleeps efficiently.
- QML/ShaderEffect owns visual interpolation/rendering without frame-rate IPC.
- Hidden state produces no continuous visual animation work.
- No duplicate daemon/process appears across shell reloads.
- Abyss panel interaction and popup geometry remain correct.
- Game Mode, reduced-motion, battery policy, suspend/resume and multi-monitor behavior are correct.
- Long-run memory/resource usage is bounded.
- Exact-SHA local validation passes.
- Maintainer accepts the live appearance and animation quality.
- The planned AI connection defaults to Local LLM, has working English settings and a connected conversation surface, handles provider failure/cancellation without disrupting Aqua, and has measured local-model resource evidence. Existing renderer evidence does not close this later AI phase.

## Out of scope for the first implementation

- continuous generative-AI personality;
- speech synthesis/listening;
- required cloud inference or automatic remote fallback (the planned local loopback model connection belongs to Phase 6);
- physically accurate full fluid simulation;
- per-pixel Rust software rendering;
- replacing every existing mascot surface in one patch;
- a second independent desktop-widget/window framework just for the companion.

## Design principle

**Rust makes the companion cheap to keep alive; Qt Quick makes it cheap to draw.** The backend decides *what the droplet is doing*, while the renderer decides *how that intent moves smoothly on screen*. The Water Droplet should feel native to Abyss because its shape, light, refraction, accent, motion gates and placement are derived from the existing Abyss material/geometry system—not because a blue mascot image was placed beside it.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 renderer/attachment proof

- Source base: `209cd2a21212b3f0d02db9488228d8567558960a`.
- Added a development-only procedural Aqua renderer under `modules/abyss/companion/`; it uses Qt Quick Shapes/primitives and Abyss theme tokens, with no image asset path.
- Added an edge-aware attachment host plus a top-edge proof scene. It is intentionally not wired into production shell ownership yet.
- Added `docs/AQUA_COMPANION_PROTOCOL_V1.md` to freeze the low-rate semantic stdio contract before daemon implementation.
- Next gate: run deterministic QML/static contract checks and capture a bounded live screenshot/Quickshell diagnostic proving render + attachment before production integration.
- Reference-asset note: the current task file contains no linked image URL/path at this HEAD; no repository reference image could be resolved from the task itself.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 Quickshell-native proof recovery

- Phase: **Phase 2 renderer/attachment proof; production integration remains disabled**.
- Current development proof commit: `822a19f1086a967a75e1e939c3a540eb0e4cb473`; the proof harness now follows Hadalis standalone-window conventions with a Quickshell `ApplicationWindow`, while `AbyssCompanion.qml` and `WaterDropletBody.qml` remain unchanged.
- Prior local evidence: `JOB-AQUA-DIAG-004:0` / `:1` on source `2e41e0aeca6917c6cdb3f42c075106b1912a65d2` established only an unclassified standalone-launch failure (exit 46); `JOB-AQUA-DIAG-006:0` on source `9d7032f45775498b4d639ecd3c144462da932c85`, observed at Unix `1790803241`, failed with classifier exit 48 and did not match the explicit Quickshell-string hypothesis. `JOB-AQUA-DIAG-005` was invalid before action execution and supplies no runtime evidence.
- Test dispatched: `JOB-AQUA-PROOF-007`, introduced by commit `92091826c525e34365cba0fe6b33aaa5406a9e81`, is pinned to base/test source `822a19f1086a967a75e1e939c3a540eb0e4cb473` and invokes the repository-confirmed `qs -n -p` standalone path before bounded runtime/service/screenshot diagnostics.
- Blocker: no Quickshell-native receipt or live visual evidence has passed yet; therefore renderer attachment is not accepted and Aqua is not wired into production ownership.
- Next: inspect `JOB-AQUA-PROOF-007`; if the exact pinned SHA loads under Quickshell, use its bounded diagnostics to advance renderer/attachment proof. If it fails, diagnose only from its published evidence before any further source change.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 committed renderer/attachment mapping proof

- Phase: **Phase 2 renderer/attachment proof structurally qualified; visual acceptance still pending; production integration remains disabled**.
- CURRENT audited/tested path: root-level `aquaProof.qml` commit `12575c626658bb73f5c716b28531c7561eef23f1`, validation job commit/source `c9b725f2aa4eb4f426d89a51004c6b5e55d7b96e`, receipt published at `4e20fda46df9faad552c60ab1a0821e5283b8f66`.
- Diagnosis evidence: `JOB-AQUA-DIAG-010:1` proved the generated minimal standalone window survived while the nested Aqua entry matched the QML-error classifier; `JOB-AQUA-DIAG-011:1` then passed with a temporary root-level wrapper and required Niri to map the Aqua proof title.
- Source fix: `37e69d6963762c745c8ca5451e41b075d2fe1ea6` added the missing `QtQuick.Controls` import to the development proof surface; `12575c626658bb73f5c716b28531c7561eef23f1` added the permanent repository-root `aquaProof.qml` entry so `qs.modules.*` resolves against the Hadalis shell root.
- Proof PASS: `JOB-AQUA-PROOF-012:0` and `:1` both exited 0 on source `c9b725f2aa4eb4f426d89a51004c6b5e55d7b96e`; the committed proof stayed alive and Niri mapped `Aqua procedural attachment proof`.
- Scope boundary: this PASS covers Quickshell load + Niri window mapping of the procedural renderer/attachment scene only. It does **not** claim screenshot/appearance acceptance, popup hit-test acceptance, canonical maintainer validation, performance qualification, or production ownership.
- Phase 1 audit started after the proof: the native workspace currently has `inir-protocol` plus five binaries and no companion daemon; `docs/AQUA_COMPANION_PROTOCOL_V1.md` freezes newline-delimited JSON state/event messages with version and monotonic sequence requirements.
- Blockers before production integration: bounded visual/screenshot acceptance of the proof scene, Rust companion core/bridge implementation and tests, hidden-idle/resource evidence, settings/policy wiring, and later canonical/live desktop validation.
- Next: implement the smallest standalone `inir-companiond` Rust core milestone (typed protocol + deterministic state machine/scheduling tests) without wiring production QML ownership yet; keep visual proof acceptance as a separate gate before Phase 3 production attachment.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 Rust companion core dispatched

- Phase: **Phase 1 Rust core implementation + exact-SHA validation; production integration remains disabled**.
- Renderer prerequisite remains structurally qualified: `JOB-AQUA-PROOF-012:0` / `:1` passed Quickshell load plus Niri window mapping for the committed root-level proof. This is not visual/maintainer acceptance.
- Core implementation commit: `5a54934a83169c570988417f121b298f1002f69a`. Added standalone workspace member `native/inir-companiond` with typed protocol/state, monotonic input sequencing, bounded 8 KiB line intake, bounded 64-record stdin channel, deterministic semantic reaction/scheduling state machine, hidden state with no scheduled wakeup, malformed-input recovery, and unit tests. `Cargo.lock` is pinned and the existing installer still does not copy/package `inir-companiond`, so Aqua is not enabled in production.
- Concurrent repository work after the core commit touched MEGAcmd rather than Aqua. Validation is therefore pinned to a newer exact source rather than assuming the core SHA remained HEAD.
- `JOB-AQUA-CORE-013` was recorded `status=invalid` with `actions=[]`: a concurrent commit landed between the read and the job-file commit, so its declared `base_sha` did not equal the job commit's first parent. It produced no runtime/test evidence and will not be reused.
- Active validation: `JOB-AQUA-CORE-014` was introduced by `d24eb5f9a65e401c75a747bf4518679a7c585b52` with first parent/base `6dadecde913e067c7910404563e82080010f4931`. It runs `cargo test --locked -p inir-companiond` plus a deterministic stdin/stdout protocol smoke for hidden -> show -> click -> hide.
- Blocker: `JOB-AQUA-CORE-014` has no result receipt yet. No Rust PASS is claimed until its exact-source actions return successfully.
- Next: inspect only `JOB-AQUA-CORE-014`. On PASS, continue with the QML stdio bridge and low-rate state interpolation while keeping production ownership disabled; on failure, diagnose only from the worker evidence before changing source.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 companion runtime shipping dispatched

- Phase: **Phase 1/3 boundary — Rust backend is qualified for development proof and now prepared for current-source runtime shipping; production companion ownership remains disabled by default**.
- Evidence already present on current `dev`: `JOB-AQUA-CORE-017:0` exited 0 at Unix `1790832251` and `:1` exited 0 at `1790832252`, both on source `dee44282f1a489ecf7d36a0f194f30ace42f9e1f`. `JOB-AQUA-BRIDGE-018:0` exited 0 at `1790832564` and `:1` at `1790832570`, both on source `fdc984e80dd8c7e4b469a9435f8888c9719b5002`; that proof required exactly one `inir-companiond` while the Aqua window was alive and zero after shutdown. `JOB-AQUA-VISUAL-019:0..3` all exited 0 on source `ad7c90470c97e35537145a14386c384f29e99046` at Unix `1790832794..1790832795`, including a private bounded screenshot/process/resource capture. These receipts prove execution/capture success, not maintainer visual acceptance.
- Runtime-shipping source commit: `10489a9deed25fdc1d1f85ae7d32eca8744ee107`. It adds a Rust-only `scripts/native-dispatch companion` route that `exec`s `inir-companiond` in place, adds the daemon to current-source install/Nix/rolling-Arch packaging contracts, and lets `CompanionBridge.qml` opt into the native dispatcher without changing the development proof override.
- Safety boundary: no Abyss production host or user-facing enable default is changed by this milestone. Aqua remains off unless a later guarded production host explicitly opts into the dispatcher.
- Validation dispatched as `JOB-AQUA-RUNTIME-020`, pinned to base/source `10489a9deed25fdc1d1f85ae7d32eca8744ee107`: companion unit tests, release build, dispatcher version smoke, native-production contract, packaging contract, and static Nix contract.
- Next: inspect only `JOB-AQUA-RUNTIME-020`. On PASS, add the single shared Abyss production bridge/host behind `abyss.companion.enabled=false`, then validate one-daemon lifecycle, output/edge placement and input-mask behavior before any default enablement.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 guarded production attachment dispatched

- Phase: **Phase 3 guarded Abyss integration; Aqua remains disabled by default and NOT_COMPLETE**.
- `JOB-AQUA-RUNTIME-020` receipt is determinate, source `8d6974ef9fe172644aa4b6acf4d4b5cffd3458f0`. Actions `:0` through `:4` all exited 0 at Unix `1790834433..1790834443`: companion Rust tests, release build, `native-dispatch companion --version`, native-production contract, and non-Nix packaging contract. Action `:5` exited 1 at Unix `1790834443`; it was the dedicated static Nix contract.
- Repository audit of the exact failed source found the first missing Nix assertion is the pre-existing Workflow-parser gate `lib.optionalString withWorkflowParser`. The same marker was already absent at pre-Aqua source `dc3d097efcf08edc09da52fceeaa0bd93346fbf3`, so this is not a Aqua regression. Per `AGENTS.md`, dedicated Nix validation remains deferred/non-blocking for the maintainer workflow.
- Guarded host source commit: `8a1023b6e368b8fc600e5b75e5e0e85aa748a86c`. It adds `abyss.companion` config with `enabled=false` and `soundEnabled=false`, one shared `CompanionBridge` for the Abyss perimeter, one output-selected `AbyssCompanion` host, fullscreen/Game Mode hiding, companion-only input masking, and reactive backend start/stop. No static mascot asset path is introduced.
- Added `scripts/test-aqua-production-contract.py` and attached it to `make test-perimeter-contracts`; the contract checks default-off/sound-off configuration, a single shared backend, one output-selected host, input-mask containment, native dispatcher routing, and static-art prohibition.
- Validation dispatched as `JOB-AQUA-HOST-021`, pinned to base `8a1023b6e368b8fc600e5b75e5e0e85aa748a86c`. It runs the Aqua contract, perimeter regression suite, exact-SHA companion Rust tests, native-production contract, and `scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh --current-repo`.
- Blockers after static/local validation: live production-host proof with the option temporarily enabled, one-daemon lifecycle across shell reload, multi-output/edge and popup hit-test evidence, battery/reduced-motion tuning, Settings UI, long-run resource qualification, and maintainer visual acceptance.
- `JOB-AQUA-HOST-021` receipt is now present. On source `6b45bb195e78f3797bab22950b16eda33c800d06`, action `:0` (Aqua production contract) exited 0; action `:1` (`make -s test-perimeter-contracts`) exited 2. The public result records only exit codes and output checksums; its bounded raw stdout/stderr are private. The failing perimeter subcheck and root cause are **undetermined**. Subsequent `dev` commits through `c1df9d31f23cda86324eef47255e7b1f8c73347a` affect automation/reporting, not Aqua host source; older PASS does not certify current HEAD.
- Manual continuation: no automation dispatch or job replay. On an exact, clean `dev` SHA, run the perimeter component checks separately (without unnecessary duplicates), record each exit code and only publish a sanitized, SHA-pinned summary under a unique `docs/` path. Keep raw diagnostics local. Do not change runtime behavior solely to satisfy a stale static assertion, and do not enable production Aqua before host/lifecycle/live validation.
- Next: read the manual diagnostic receipt and inspect the identified failing component. If it needs private evidence not safely publishable, request only that evidence; otherwise fix the proven issue and rerun the required exact-SHA gates before guarded live-host proof.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 manual perimeter root-cause isolation

- On exact source `f3a1faaf3c2ea955818759a1cb777dc92272872a`, committed sanitized report `docs/aqua-manual-perimeter-20261001T111318Z-ecdc18de-f3a1faaf3c2e.json` records 9/10 component checks PASS, including Aqua production/default-off contract. Only `perimeter-shared-and-source` failed (exit 1), classified as the **source** sub-contract. These are historical results, not a current-HEAD acceptance.
- Read the current and pre-Aqua `modules/screenCorners/ScreenCorners.qml`: both omit `GlobalStates.openOrbit(` and explicitly assign overview priority to `NiriService.isOverviewHotCornerActive(outputName, cornerName)`. Existing `scripts/test-quick-notes-corner-contract.py` explicitly rejects the retired Orbit entry. `scripts/test-perimeter-source-contracts.sh` contradicted both by requiring the removed Orbit call. This stale regression assertion is one definite source-contract failure; do not infer that no further assertions may fail until a new test completes.
- Source-only test fix: commit `ea46df3955acb9b6c92d6c47103affa40f9c42ba` replaces the retired Orbit requirement with assertions for compositor-owned Niri overview priority and continued absence of Orbit routing. It makes **no production runtime/Aqua change**; Aqua remains disabled by default.
- Next gate: test the corrected source contract on the current exact `dev` SHA, then run relevant perimeter, Rust, native shipping and canonical maintainer acceptance without claiming success from older SHA. Keep raw logs local and publish only a sanitized SHA-pinned report. After PASS, proceed to guarded live host, one-daemon and output/input lifetime evidence.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 manual perimeter regression PASS

- Independent manual diagnostic receipt `docs/aqua-manual-perimeter-20261001T112408Z-e91462e7-642c676c2ce0.json` on exact source `642c676c2ce03ad5635c7fbbe3f278a1ce5da206` records **10/10 PASS** (Iris production, input lifecycle, Quick Notes, Aqua production, placement, family, routes, settings, shared/source and retirement). The formerly failing source sub-contract exited **0** following the retired-Orbit/Niri-priority assertion correction. Logs remain private; the committed sanitized report exposes per-check exit codes only.
- This resolves the known perimeter contract blocker for that exact SHA, **not** canonical acceptance of later dev commits. The report explicitly marks canonical validation and live visual acceptance `not_run`.
- Next gate: on one clean exact-SHA local checkout, independently record Aqua Rust tests, locked release build, dispatcher version smoke (using the binary built for that SHA), native packaging contract, and the canonical `scripts/validate-maintainer-local.sh --current-repo` result. Keep verbose logs local; publish only sanitized status and exact SHA. Do not enable Aqua by default or claim multi-output/lifecycle/live qualification without real host evidence.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 guarded-host unexpected-exit audit

- Static lifecycle audit (pending live verification): `CompanionBridge.qml` sets `ready=false` and resets `inboundSeq` when `backendProcess.running` becomes false; `onExited` also clears only `ready`. Neither path clears its last `visibility`. Meanwhile `AbyssPerimeter.qml` binds the companion's `reveal` to `companionBridge.visibility` and includes a revealed, interactive host in the native input mask. Thus an unanticipated daemon exit **can** leave a stale visible companion and interactive region until another valid state update or an explicit backend-disable reset. This is a source-level risk, not a reproduced live failure.
- Post-qualification fix gate: ensure host rendering and input fail closed whenever the bridge is not `ready` (or clear stale visibility on unexpected exit), while preserving the queued show intent for a permitted restart. Add a targeted contract for unexpected exit, restart initial handshake and disabled-by-default behavior. Run the relevant current-SHA contract, native/Rust gate and canonical validation after any runtime change. Do not silently count pre-change perimeter results as acceptance.
- The manually prepared `scripts/aqua-manual-qualification.py` has **no committed report** as of this audit. Do not treat local execution, release build, dispatcher smoke or canonical validation as complete without a SHA-pinned receipt. Its source-sensitive review guard intentionally requires review before accepting future runtime/contract changes.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 native qualification receipt and fail-closed host fix

- New sanitized native/canonical result: `docs/aqua-manual-qualification-20261001T115741Z-f9da4543-6d7eb8d2a831.json` on exact source `6d7eb8d2a83143b5437c4e1d0a2a0570f7048870`: 5/6 independent checks PASS (Rust unit, locked Rust release, dispatcher version, native production contract and packaging metadata). `canonical-maintainer-validator` exited 1 after 501.06 seconds. The public receipt omits the specific failing canonical check, so root cause is **unknown**; do not attribute this failure to Aqua or MegaQML without evidence. The historical 10/10 perimeter PASS applies to `642c676c2ce03ad5635c7fbbe3f278a1ce5da206`, not the revised Aqua source.
- A bounded source audit exposed a real guarded-host risk on unexpected daemon exit: bridge `ready=false` did not independently gate host rendering or its companion input region. Atomic source/test commit `7bb1f99b0cd932c7bb0e50888ae19c982d7e1ec3` now requires `companionBridge.ready` in `companionHostActive`, immediately hides the Aqua host while unready, and checks the reset/re-handshake contract. The queued `requestedVisible` intent remains intact; default enabled/sound values remain false. **Static source inspection only**; new code has not earned local or live PASS.
- To diagnose the historical canonical exit without rerunning an expensive validator or exposing private raw logs, `scripts/aqua-canonical-failure-receipt.py` reads only the matching previous local validator's final summary, publishes allowlisted failed check names/groups and numbers to a unique `docs/` JSON report, and retains verbose logs locally. No automation/background workers. If no matching old local log exists, report that prerequisite rather than inventing findings.
- Next: read the new sanitized canonical-failure classifier receipt, determine whether the actual failing check is Aqua-related, and make only justified fixes. Then perform fresh current-SHA perimeter/native/canonical validation on the revised host; separate live daemon exit/restart, single-process, input region, multi-output, reduced-motion/resource and maintainer visual acceptance gates remain open. Do not enable Aqua by default.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 canonical failure classification and focused follow-up

- Original prior canonical failure (source `6d7eb8d2a83143b5437c4e1d0a2a0570f7048870`) has a sanitized classification receipt at `docs/aqua-canonical-failures-20261001T121228Z-05455b4b-6d7eb8d2a831.json`: **293 checks run; 257 passed, 35 failed, 2 skipped**. It identifies one Aqua-specific failure in `scripts/test-aqua-manual-perimeter.py`; that file is a manual branch-checking diagnostic/report publisher, not a standalone regression and cannot succeed when the canonical validator invokes all `test-*.py` on a detached clone. Other 34 failures include Abyss/UI and other components; this report records names/exit codes only, not their causes. No failed `scripts/test-aqua-production-contract.py` entry was recorded. Do not infer current-HEAD PASS or attribute unrelated regressions to Aqua.
- Canonical discovery fix `9976e08d7db2537af747541afdba987515635b9b` skips **only** the manual Aqua publisher while retaining ordinary tracked Python syntax and the automated Aqua production test. The production contract now guards this exclusion against accidental removal. Canonical validation remains **NOT PASSED** until the other actual failed cases are diagnosed and a new exact-SHA run succeeds.
- Guarded post-exit source fix `7bb1f99b0cd932c7bb0e50888ae19c982d7e1ec3` remains pending new execution evidence. To avoid repeating a known-failing global canonical run while qualifying Aqua-specific changes, `scripts/aqua-manual-qualification.py --focused` was added in `17f7a94f9f232cf79c2deb2a8b86edc7675c83ee`. It runs Aqua production + perimeter regression, companion Rust tests + release build, exact-build native dispatcher version, native production contract and packaging metadata; bounded logs stay local, the unique sanitized report is SHA-pinned on `dev`, and its `canonical_validation` field explicitly records `not_run`.
- Next: inspect focused receipt first. If it passes, keep canonical global acceptance and live desktop acceptance as separate open gates; if it fails, diagnose only identified checks and rerun after any further fixes. Then validate daemon exit/restart, single-process ownership, output/edge/input-region interaction and visual/resource acceptance on a live Niri host. Never enable Aqua by default without those gates.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 focused post-fix qualification PASS; isolated lifecycle probe prepared

- Committed receipt `docs/aqua-manual-qualification-20261001T121835Z-f53b4dbe-cf28b0fb2202.json` on exact source `cf28b0fb22026cb0fdd3eb0d7178d0b6787de7c8` records **7/7 PASS**: Aqua production contract, complete perimeter regression, companion Rust tests, locked release build, exact-build native dispatcher smoke, native production contract, and package metadata. It includes the fail-closed host readiness fix `7bb1f99b0cd932c7bb0e50888ae19c982d7e1ec3`. These are local/static checks, not a live daemon crash, visual, or multi-output proof.
- The historical 35-failure canonical result remains outstanding. Excluding the manual Aqua publisher from the detached-clone test discovery via `9976e08d7db2537af747541afdba987515635b9b` addresses one *identified* harness mismatch, not the other failure causes. Do not mark global canonical accepted.
- New isolated diagnostic groundwork on `dev`: `scripts/aqua-fixtures/bridge-exit/shell.qml` and `fake-dispatch.py` instantiate a copied real CompanionBridge under a private offscreen Quickshell configuration and simulate one deliberate fake-backend exit followed by a re-handshake. `scripts/aqua-manual-bridge-smoke.py` runs disabled/default-off and exit/restart scenarios, writes bounded private logs and a SHA-pinned sanitized `docs/aqua-bridge-isolation-*.json` receipt. The fake dispatcher is confined to a temporary fixture; no production/user configuration or real vendor daemon is enabled. This **is not yet run or accepted**.
- Next: inspect the isolated bridge receipt. On PASS, advance to a separately authorized, bounded **real Niri guarded production host** check for mapped output, input-mask non-interference, backend exit/restart and one-process lifecycle; then visual/resource acceptance and global canonical recovery. If Quickshell is unavailable, retain an explicit inconclusive receipt rather than calling it a pass. Maintain default-off Aqua and do not alter `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 isolated bridge PASS and inherited-daemon-override guard

- Sanitized isolated Quickshell receipt `docs/aqua-bridge-isolation-20261001T122458Z-4ce0b139-b7077ea8950d.json` was published as commit `31939f07b190f81f514bd1f70e1315f86b8a99cb` after a fast-forward-only retry. On source `b7077ea8950dc8fccb673adaabf1a6c8d0f496de`, both tests passed: disabled/default-off spawned **0** fake daemons and forced fake-daemon exit plus re-handshake spawned **2** as intended. The proof used private offscreen Quickshell, not the real Niri production host. The historical focused Aqua contract/native receipt remains 7/7 PASS on its own exact earlier SHA.
- New source-audit finding after the bridge proof: a globally inherited `INIR_COMPANIOND` environment override could bypass the production host's disabled-by-default dispatcher setting because `CompanionBridge.backendCommand` prefers `binaryPath`. Fix commit `d7d6290bc9e27b17c18c9576fc94ff12e470cca5` explicitly gates **production** `binaryPath` behind `root.companionEnabled`, preserving standalone proof overrides. An assertion in the production contract protects this source boundary. This is a proactive default-off fix, not a confirmed observed live failure.
- Test expansion commit `22cd281781b0d221ad92a2165e0730609a843354` adds isolated `disabled-override` to the two original bridge cases and advances the reviewed Aqua focused qualification baseline. The third case intentionally sets `INIR_COMPANIOND` while disabled and requires **0** fake daemon starts, in addition to checking `backendEnabled=false`.
- Publication hardening commit `ba6e1d8a273f41454dcfa721acc812efe8a7d85c` adds bounded retry for both manual runners on a moving `dev`. Before retrying, it refetches and audits the remote and rebases/amends **only the single unpublished sanitized report commit**, updating its publication parent. Never force push, rewrite shared history, publish raw logs, or run background jobs.
- Next exact-SHA gate: execute the expanded 3-case isolated bridge smoke and the 7-check focused Aqua native/perimeter qualification against the *new* guarded source; publish both sanitized reports. Until fresh results arrive, the new environment guard and third fixture remain unqualified. Global canonical and separately observed live Niri production-host, multi-output/input-mask, one-real-daemon lifecycle, resource and visual acceptance remain outstanding; Aqua defaults remain off.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 guarded source PASS and real-Niri standalone probe ready

- The guarded inherited-override Aqua source now has **two fresh sanitized qualification receipts**: isolated offscreen Quickshell `docs/aqua-bridge-isolation-20261001T123951Z-d8b180d7-8e4288351a78.json`, on source `8e4288351a784e5bb3e2591ee8ea8a01fde6a03c`, confirms **3/3 PASS** (default-off: 0 fake backends, default-off with inherited `INIR_COMPANIOND`: 0 fake backends, forced fake exit/restart: 2 starts). Subsequent focused native/perimeter receipt `docs/aqua-manual-qualification-20261001T124007Z-e662331b-ba17bae9f6ef.json`, on source `ba17bae9f6ef3ab25445e08cecea7074050d8574`, confirms **7/7 PASS** (production/perimeter, companion Rust unit and release, dispatcher, native shipping and packaging). Source changes between the exact SHAs were limited to reports, not Aqua runtime. Both receipts explicitly leave canonical and live production-host acceptance `not_run`.
- Next distinct gate: `scripts/aqua-manual-niri-proof.py` introduced in `a4153d4840b72d1f9ad76c072a546d3d8f44dbda`. Run it manually from a clean `dev` checkout in the owner's actual Niri session. It builds a **private exact-SHA** release `inir-companiond` and launches a single bounded `qs -n -p aquaProof.qml` child, uses Niri's JSON window inventory to detect a newly mapped `[present]` proof window and `/proc/*/exe` to require one private daemon, samples bounded RSS, and verifies both owned child and new window shut down after cleanup. It isolates its XDG config/data/cache/state directories, keeps raw logs private, and may publish PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE as `docs/aqua-niri-proof-*.json`. It never changes existing user shell config or enables production Aqua and never runs as a persistent worker. No successful execution or live result is claimed yet.
- This is **standalone proof**, not an Abyss production-host test, not input-mask/hotplug/multi-monitor/fractional-scaling or visual-quality acceptance. Global canonical still has unrelated failures. On a valid standalone PASS, proceed to a separately controlled production-host session and live renderer/performance observations; do not turn Aqua on by default or modify `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 real Niri proof PASS and bounded daemon restart under test

- Committed `docs/aqua-niri-proof-20261001T124709Z-033217ce-ede831d004b6.json` as `6d49fb08df49c40c4544d75fac7b9e9564e8345c`. On exact source `ede831d004b6e94031a983e8a66d27d9cc92c69e`, **standalone** real Niri/Quickshell plus privately built Rust daemon **PASS**: release build exit 0; newly mapped `[present]` proof window; one private daemon; owned daemon stopped; own window unmapped; peak sampled daemon VmRSS **2672 KiB**. Raw observations remain local. Not a production Abyss host, input-mask, multi-output, visual, or canonical acceptance. MegaQML-only changes between this source and its publication do not change Aqua runtime.
- Source lifecycle audit found the production bridge still lacked *automatic* process recovery after unexpected termination despite being fail-closed and preserving `requestedVisible`. The design TODO explicitly calls for exponential backoff and duplicate-process protection. `af2565174916c12a8360b2566ba755d00c050777` adds at most **four automatic attempts** at 500/1000/2000/4000 ms while backend remains enabled; stops pending attempts on explicit disable; suppresses late child stdout while disabled/unready; and resets its retry budget only after 30 seconds of stable handshake. Both process termination callbacks schedule through one guarded timer to prevent double starts. A depleted budget remains stopped until explicit disable/re-enable. The production host's ready-based opacity/input-mask guard and default-off configuration remain in place.
- The same commit extends the inert fake daemon with an always-failing crash-budget mode, and the isolated QML fixture with automatic single-crash recovery and exhausted-budget assertions. Followup `b7af0aedc98f556f3b938adf72e2de1183114b3d` advances source guards and adds **five** manual bridge matrix cases: disabled, disabled with inherited environment override, explicit exit/restart, automatic exit/restart, and bounded repeated crash. The reviewed focused native/perimeter and bounded real-Niri proof runners are re-anchored to the new source. These **new source and test changes have not earned a PASS yet**; earlier 3/3, 7/7 and real-Niri proof receipts are historical exact-SHA evidence only.
- Next execute the updated five-case offscreen bridge, seven-check focused native/perimeter, and bounded real-Niri standalone proof in **one** manual command; publish three sanitized receipts on `dev`. If the new retry mechanism fails, investigate the specific failing check first. The canonical global failures and real production Abyss host, layer/input-mask, output/hotplug, visual/resource gates remain separate. Never enable Aqua by default or touch `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 bounded recovery 5/5, native 7/7 and real Niri PASS

- The new bounded automatic recovery logic has now been **run and verified**. Sanitized bridge report `docs/aqua-bridge-isolation-20261001T125520Z-89265409-521100717e61.json`, exact source `521100717e61c85038a5457d8f4b196f92cceb21`, records **5/5 PASS**: disabled and inherited binary override each started zero fake children; explicit exit/restart and automatic exit/restart each started two; crash-budget started exactly five children (initial + four retries) and stopped. The two newer reports are `docs/aqua-manual-qualification-20261001T125539Z-47a9f48d-6d30f92e3661.json` (on `6d30f92e366170e25907744c0fbbc8495f552d27`, **7/7 PASS**, production/perimeter/Rust/release/dispatcher/packaging) and `docs/aqua-niri-proof-20261001T125559Z-3e25f617-c33efac2dc54.json` (on `c33efac2dc54b8e45d2220575321339bab36cb20`, **PASS** real Rust daemon + standalone Quickshell on Niri, mapped window, one owned daemon, cleanup verified, peak sampled RSS 2628 KiB). All three runs include the automatic-recovery production source `af2565174916c12a8360b2566ba755d00c050777`; intervening non-Aqua changes are MegaQML and report-only. These results do **not** certify live Abyss production host, user visual quality or canonical validation.
- Next uncovered recovery boundaries: (a) turning Aqua off **while the first 500 ms retry timer is pending** must cancel the retry and create no more children; (b) exhausting the four-retry budget must allow a **deliberate off/on** to start a fresh attempt without any unrequested infinite loop. The fixture/fake-only commit `6403d2b8e2fcdafd150e7f5274026df788359f67` introduces two scenarios, and `926ad5a83720521f99438f684448efb5b0051029` advances the SHA-guarded runner to **seven cases**, allowing only known sanitized markers/counts. Aqua production code is unchanged after the prior 5/7/live PASS receipts. **New tests have not yet run**: publish the new seven-case receipt before marking either new recovery boundary PASS.
- Once that new bridge receipt has been reviewed, address safe, independently observable **production Abyss layer-host** correctness on a temporary desktop session without overriding existing user config, hijacking unrelated shell ownership or assuming that a standalone proof verifies input masks. Canonical global recovery, output/hotplug, suspend/reload, user visual comparison and final opt-in remain open. Aqua remains disabled by default; `stable` is untouched.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 recovery 7/7 PASS and shared production host policy awaiting qualification

- Latest bounded offscreen bridge receipt `docs/aqua-bridge-isolation-20261001T130310Z-5cbc6880-655bcf554c6b.json` was published in `2e6100d034312d487109f5dc84565473d1f78a22` for exact source `655bcf554c6b836013aad4101bdddea2e106727c`: **7/7 PASS**. The new `disable-pending` case observed only one fake daemon and canceled the pending retry. The new `budget-reset` case observed six starts (initial, four bounded retries, one deliberate re-enable); all original five scenarios also passed. It does not claim production input-mask or Niri host acceptance.
- Source integration `a7c7c6f794c54d41912c21de51a2c89061437b62` replaces three duplicated production-host predicates with pure `modules/abyss/companion/AquaHostPolicy.js` functions for target-output and readiness ownership, input activation, and bounded `alongPosition`. The latter preserves normal-scale placement but centers on a tiny logical output when normal margins cannot fit. The production `AbyssPerimeter.qml` consumes all three helpers, and production contract + `scripts/test-aqua-host-policy.py` assert the wiring and exercise many output, readiness, input and viewport permutations. Production Aqua defaults remain disabled. This source refactor has **not yet earned new local or live PASS**.
- Isolated fixture and runner commit `f6008cdaebf465ae7065c0e822f141b92d2f25f2` imports the **same** production JS policy next to the copied real bridge. Seven scenarios now also test per-output ownership and immediate logical input release upon the fake backend exit. Followup `be532047ac933cc3411e78e97ea0e2cdad66e343` re-anchors the focused qualification and guards the new dynamic host-policy test against unreviewed edits; focused scope is now **8 checks**, up from seven. These new reports are **pending execution**, not PASS.
- Next: run the new output/input policy test, 7-case offscreen bridge and 8-check focused qualification on an exact clean `dev` SHA and inspect the sanitized receipts. The subsequent distinct milestone is a safely controlled **actual production Abyss PanelWindow** desktop test of layer mapping/input passthrough, then multiple live outputs/hotplug and maintainer visual review. Standalone Niri proof and synthetic host logic cannot substitute for those. Global canonical is still not accepted, and `stable` remains untouched.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 shared host policy 7/7 + focused 8/8; isolated production-layer probe staged

- Verified two new sanitized runtime/local receipts on `dev`: `docs/aqua-bridge-isolation-20261001T131232Z-16cc10f7-15c32970f8e5.json` on exact source `15c32970f8e508c12ae070bd4d0b88f5721d4e4c` is **7/7 PASS** with the *real shared* Aqua production JS host policy imported into isolated Quickshell alongside the real CompanionBridge. `docs/aqua-manual-qualification-20261001T131857Z-49f7237b-970b8d65e791.json` on exact source `970b8d65e791e4b9c7a90b0f8d39851a29b2ef34` is **8/8 PASS**, including the new executable output/input/viewport host policy and the existing seven native/perimeter/package checks. Intervening changed files are MegaQML and result documents, not Aqua production sources. These results are not physical pointer pass-through or live Abyss production PanelWindow evidence.
- New opt-in proof groundwork on `dev` in commit `ae14ff81a35400019cd4bd5ca0efe29be49f4b5d`: `scripts/aqua-fixtures/production-layer/shell.qml` instantiates the **unmodified actual** `AbyssPerimeter`; `scripts/aqua-manual-production-layer.py` creates isolated XDG directories, per-test empty optional panel configuration, isolated session D-Bus, private exact-source Cargo target and bounded child Quickshell sessions. It first checks Niri's JSON layer inventory and **does not launch** any temporary layer if namespace `hadalis:abyss-perimeter` is already in use. The runner requires `--acknowledge-temporary-layer`, tests disabled with an inherited daemon path before any enabled run, checks one mapped production layer per active output, no unrequested layer keyboard focus, one private daemon only when enabled, and own child/layer cleanup. Failures/inconclusive preflights are separately classified and sanitized under `docs/aqua-production-layer-*.json`; raw logs and private config remain local. `scripts/test-aqua-production-layer-contract.py` provides a syntax/source-safety contract. **These new fixtures/runner have not yet been executed; no live production host PASS is claimed.**
- Crucial limit: Niri's layer listing reports namespace/output/layer/keyboard interactivity, **not the exact pointer-input mask, rendered Aqua visibility or user visual quality**. Even if the isolated production layer receipt passes, independently inspect actual pointer pass-through, edge placement/reveal, animations, multi-monitor hotplug, shell reload/suspend, and visual/resource outcomes before approving normal production enablement. Global canonical validation remains open. Do not change default-off Aqua or `stable`.

- Follow-up guard `850691d85660620fa1ccc34fafba886630b7478c` hardens the same not-yet-executed opt-in runner: an alternate allowlisted GitHub push URL is permitted, but only one push URL; the private diagnostic directory must remain **outside the checkout**; and source auditing permits precisely this one reviewed runner revision. Its updated production-layer safety contract remains a required prerequisite. The earlier probe must not be described as an executed or accepted host test.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 active Abyss prevents parallel production probe; read-only inventory prepared

- Opt-in live temporary PanelWindow receipt `docs/aqua-production-layer-20261001T140538Z-94d94872-a1a043e6cc3f.json` on source `a1a043e6cc3f18c11deea4d6a77fc6e9fa34b3c0` is **INCONCLUSIVE** with preflight reason `abyss_perimeter_already_running`. Niri observed one active output; the safety guard correctly refused to launch a second `hadalis:abyss-perimeter` layer. Its `tests` array is empty. Do not call this PASS or FAIL, do not recommend killing the user's running shell, and do not claim production Aqua, pointer mask, visual, canonical, or hotplug acceptance.
- Follow-up `aff8e8b3b2f805cdbaf40d77630378ac48cc8506` adds `scripts/aqua-manual-existing-layer.py` and `scripts/test-aqua-existing-layer-contract.py`. This **read-only** alternative samples Niri `layers` and `outputs` four times, counts the already running `hadalis:abyss-perimeter` surfaces per active output and observable keyboard mode (without storing device names), and classifies stable complete coverage, duplicate layer inventory or inconsistent observations. It **never** opens another shell, reads or changes user configuration, enables Aqua, sends pointer/keyboard input or claims running shell binary-source identity. It still publishes only a unique sanitized report on a clean `dev` checkout with bounded fast-forward retry.
- Required next gate: run its local synthetic `scripts/test-aqua-existing-layer-contract.py` followed by `python3 scripts/aqua-manual-existing-layer.py --observe-current-session`, inspect the SHA-pinned `docs/aqua-existing-layer-*.json` report, and address any real layer-inventory anomaly. This verifies compositor-visible active-layer topology only; Niri layer inventory **cannot** observe exact pointer masks or whether Aqua is enabled. The previous guarded standalone real-Niri proof remains valid for its earlier SHA; live production Aqua enablement and interactive/visual acceptance still require a separately controlled session. Global canonical red and `stable` untouched.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 live existing Abyss 4/4 PASS and guarded nested Niri milestone

- Live read-only observation on source `7029ce5618b08dda817774fd3f1fa1e3ccad6903` published as `docs/aqua-existing-layer-20261001T141653Z-d6ec2c70-7029ce5618b0.json`, commit `bec798f633aa500ca7a0ba527143b895d4dba241`: **PASS, four consecutive samples** at 500 ms intervals. Niri reported exactly one active display and exactly one existing `hadalis:abyss-perimeter` layer on that display; no duplicates, no inactive-output/orphan layers, and observed keyboard interactivity `none` in all four samples. It is strictly the currently running shell's *compositor-visible layer topology*, **not** verification of which Git SHA is running, whether Aqua is enabled, pointer pass-through, live Aqua rendering, or multioutput behavior. The earlier side-by-side isolated production test properly returned INCONCLUSIVE because that one running layer exists.
- A controlled alternative is now staged on `dev` by `fe4fa400ec9ac1a643c858b697ae515c735d523a`: `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-niri.py` plus an inert `scripts/test-aqua-nested-niri-contract.py`. With explicit `--acknowledge-nested-niri`, the coordinator uses an empty private `NIRI_CONFIG` to run exactly one owned nested Niri **inside a normal Wayland window**, detects a *different* Wayland display and IPC socket, checks a usable nested output and absence of existing Abyss layers there, then invokes the *existing reviewed* two-phase real production PanelWindow Rust/Quickshell runner against only the nested socket. It preserves host `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and `NIRI_SOCKET` in separate variables, does not kill or reconfigure the running user's compositor/shell, waits for private child and nested cleanup, verifies the host output count is unchanged, retains unfiltered logs locally, and may publish a sanitized `docs/aqua-nested-niri-*.json` report. If nested Winit Niri or its layer IPC is unavailable, mark INCONCLUSIVE, not PASS. These new scripts **have not yet run**; their exact-SHA syntax/inert contract check must precede the real invocation.
- Even an isolated real production PanelWindow PASS on nested Niri would only qualify compositor mapping, requested keyboard mode, disabled default-off with inherited executable override, enabled one-owned-real-daemon lifecycle and cleanup in that nested environment. It does **not** certify the existing live user shell's source identity, physical mouse hit-test/pass-through, edge visuals, hotplug/multiple real outputs, compositor restart/suspend, or full canonical validation. Keep production defaults off, keep private diagnostic paths out of Git, and never alter `stable`.

- Follow-up safety fix `c5b1ec2709c72c91d100f92ca1451dd20c4edbce` guards the nested compositor's process-group cleanup: never signal a numeric group if the owned Niri parent already exited and the ID could have been reused. The source audit permits exactly the reviewed initial runner and this one safety revision, and pins the initial blob. This opt-in nested proof still has no execution report or live pointer acceptance yet.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 nested production host PASS; standalone hidden-idle resource gate staged

- The nested Niri controlled production-host receipt is now **PASS**, not merely planned: `docs/aqua-nested-niri-20261001T142650Z-d57cd21c-569f1b863af2.json` on exact source `569f1b863af2fcd45a2ffcfc6bdce1a8b7982ce8` reports distinct private Wayland and Niri IPC endpoints, one nested output, no pre-existing Abyss layer, child exit 0, complete owned nested compositor cleanup and unchanged host output count. Its linked independent child receipt `docs/aqua-production-layer-20261001T142651Z-8275d996-569f1b863af2.json` reports **2/2 PASS** on the actual unchanged `AbyssPerimeter` PanelWindow in nested Niri: disabled despite inherited executable override (zero private daemon), and enabled with exactly one owned real Rust daemon. Both phases observed one production layer per active output, no unwanted keyboard focus, full private process/layer cleanup. All these claims are limited to their source SHA and single nested output; native pointer pass-through, running host source identity, physical multioutput/hotplug, visual quality and global canonical are still not measured. Keep Aqua default-off and never touch `stable`.
- A separate Phase 4 backend resource qualification is staged on `dev` at `165a1f8541654e666477e3ea7ed64ae4774a8e6f`: `scripts/aqua-manual-idle-resource.py` and its inert `scripts/test-aqua-idle-resource-contract.py`. It uses an exact-SHA locked private Rust release build, exercises actual versioned show/hide handshakes and records **13 /proc samples across 60 seconds of hidden idle**. Its explicit provisional budgets are peak RSS <=32768 KiB, growth <=4096 KiB, hidden CPU <=0.5 s and zero unsolicited stdout reads; sample count, observed measurements, one-owned-process and full cleanup are reported without exposing raw logs. These are conservative *test thresholds*, not an established production long-run memory target. The script uses a unique private Cargo target and refuses to keep diagnostic files inside the checkout. **It has not yet run**, so do not promote Phase 4 resource acceptance until its SHA-pinned sanitized receipt is checked.
- Run the inert contract and 60-second native idle probe only, rather than repeating already PASS 7/7 bridge, 8/8 focused native/perimeter or nested host acceptance. The next independent gate after this measurement is a deliberately authorized visual/pointer test of the actual production Aqua against an interactive underlay in nested Niri; available compositor layer inventory does not establish pointer pass-through or accurate hit regions. Another distinct gate is long-run shell/reload/suspend and physical multioutput qualification; global canonical failures remain separate.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 hidden-idle 3/3 PASS; four-edge clickable geometry pending

- Three independently published, exact-source private Rust hidden-idle receipts **PASS 3/3**: `docs/aqua-idle-resource-20261001T143515Z-2d8edc1d-b2d6e7728e65.json` on `b2d6e7728e6549ac6431e85a560ad1ba88b445b2` (peak **2664 KiB**), `docs/aqua-idle-resource-20261001T143822Z-88f9b83e-61839bc12d27.json` on `61839bc12d27a605d277aadccea3fc1cfdf5d64b` (peak **2680 KiB**) and `docs/aqua-idle-resource-20261001T144009Z-a1ec8630-5a3a2526aeac.json` on `5a3a2526aeace69a5f7a3e72448eaa6a6654d086` (peak **2672 KiB**). Each accepted initial hidden/show/hide, sampled 13 times over 60 seconds, observed **0 KiB RSS growth**, **0.0 s measured hidden CPU**, **zero unsolicited hidden stdout**, exactly one private daemon while active and none after cleanup. No production Aqua/native code changed between these source SHAs; newer shared commits are unrelated MegaQML/results. This is one-minute *standalone Rust* evidence only; not whole-Quickshell resources, unlimited uptime, input or visual acceptance.
- The production Abyss compositor mask currently uses the *entire* `AbyssCompanion` item, while its hover/click handlers live in the smaller `WaterDropletBody` child. A tighter mask could avoid capturing unrelated edge clicks, but **must not be applied blindly** because the clickable child rotates for left/right/bottom edges; this is a source-observed possible optimization, **not** a reproduced hit-test defect. Geometry diagnostic `b3479455e05a5b60ffce850a27cba5aecbf0bda4` introduces `scripts/aqua-fixtures/footprint/shell.qml`, `scripts/aqua-manual-footprint.py`, `scripts/test-aqua-footprint-contract.py`. The private offscreen fixture measures real, unchanged QML child corners mapped onto four host orientations and publishes bounded bounding-box and overhang facts only. Safety update `5c16f743bc2f79d0aae479fdf1ddb0c3c417c047` pins reviewed source and escalates teardown on a hung fixture. **No four-edge execution receipt yet**; production mask has not been changed.
- Run the inert contract then `python3 scripts/aqua-manual-footprint.py --observe-footprint` from one clean `dev` checkout. Use that receipt to decide a region geometry change; mapped boxes alone are **not a physical pointer-pass-through test**. A subsequent independently controlled compositor pointer interaction, maintainer visual comparison, full-shell long-run measurement, physical multioutput/reload/suspend and canonical-wide validation remain open. Aqua defaults off; never alter `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 4-edge footprint exposes overflow; centered prototype pending execution

- Real unmodified QML geometry receipt `docs/aqua-footprint-20261001T145330Z-44ee61ee-34b14b3d8f6e.json` on exact source `34b14b3d8f6e4d1986dd528d7c8b51e9856b0004`, published as `a5345a22a1e7be2b1ee324cf48df5071112b4649`, **PASS only for four-edge diagnostic execution**, not for containment or hit-testing. Offscreen `AbyssCompanion` measured mapped `WaterDropletBody` boxes: top (18,6,76×92) fully contained; right (-43,74,92×76), bottom (18,98,76×92), left (49,74,92×76) **protrude beyond their 98×112 or 112×98 host boxes**. These three overflow flags mean a blind reduced compositor hit region could clip interaction. The existing production full-host mask may also capture non-body space; actual compositor mouse pass-through has not been measured. Do not call the previous PASS a four-edge layout or pointer PASS.
- Candidate experiment commit `2aa15b2963597cf3eaccc7ef0d660062f8db4bbb` adds `scripts/aqua-fixtures/centered-prototype/shell.qml`, `scripts/aqua-manual-centered-prototype.py` and `scripts/test-aqua-centered-prototype-contract.py`. A separate isolated **offscreen-only** fixture instantiates four instances of the unchanged real production `AbyssCompanion` and temporarily resets each actual child `WaterDropletBody` to `anchors.centerIn = host` with `transformOrigin = Item.Center` rather than its current bottom anchor and bottom rotation origin. The bounded exact-source runner checks whether all four mapped child bounds stay in their host with less than 90% host-area occupancy, publishes only sanitized numbers/flags and leaves all production QML, input masks, live compositor and settings unchanged. The candidate is **NOT YET RUNTIME-QUALIFIED**; the conceptual center-origin placement is an experiment, not a committed production fix.
- Next: execute the inert contract followed by one manual offscreen candidate run against a clean, SHA-reviewed `dev`; examine the new `docs/aqua-centered-prototype-*.json` before any production edit. If all four geometries fit, consider the minimum reviewed `AbyssCompanion` anchor/origin change and a separately gated Quickshell host-area vs inner body Region policy change with fresh 7-case bridge, 8-check focused and 2-phase isolated production-host qualification. Preserve click/hover in all orientations, keep default-off and unchanged `stable`. If candidate fails, diagnose private QML warnings and revise fixture instead of making speculative production changes. Even successful mapped rectangles do **not** establish physical pointer hit-testing or visual/animation acceptance.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 centered prototype 4/4 PASS; production layout pending exact-SHA geometry and focused gates

- Isolated, unmodified-component *prototype* receipt `docs/aqua-centered-prototype-20261001T150053Z-22dbb28f-80965c73af11.json` on source `80965c73af11a38b8a9c90e546b942c70fe88982`, committed as `4d0cb02825ade80786f880db421bb8771560a5c6`, is **PASS**: runtime-only center anchor plus center rotation origin places mapped clickable `WaterDropletBody` within all four `AbyssCompanion` hosts. Top/bottom body box (18,3,76×92) and left/right body box (3,18,92×76) each occupy approximately **63.7%** of host area; no overhang. This is QML-mapped geometry only, not a physical input or screenshot pass.
- Minimum production layout fix `5dde4e2f0559b7adac52ab0438435884236c24f9` applies only `transformOrigin: Item.Center` and `anchors.centerIn: parent` to the real `modules/abyss/companion/AbyssCompanion.qml` body, preserving orientation, hover/tap wiring, all default-off policies and the **unchanged complete host compositor mask**. This source change needs *its own* execution evidence; earlier offscreen prototype and nested production receipts predate it and cannot certify the new production SHA.
- Source-guarded proof `82ac379e65fe8be65df14a7fca19675a5076f8e5` adds `scripts/aqua-manual-production-geometry.py` plus `scripts/test-aqua-production-geometry-contract.py`. It runs the ORIGINAL four-edge offscreen fixture on the **updated real production component without any runtime anchor overrides**, requires all four mapped bodies to fit within host bounds while occupying less than 90% of host area, explicitly pins reviewed QML and fixture blobs, and publishes only a sanitized `docs/aqua-production-geometry-*.json` report. Focused eight-check qualification was re-anchored in `6d2db8ffd3995de15834fcc61a85aacbefaac08c` to the reviewed new production geometry source/runner. **Neither the new production geometry runner nor the focused eight-check qualifier has been rerun after the fix.**
- Next local gate: from one clean `dev` checkout, run the inert production-geometry contract, its four-edge real QML probe and (only if geometry PASS) the 8-check focused native/perimeter qualification. The two manual runners each publish a distinct exact-source sanitized receipt. Do not claim new runtime PASS until these arrive. Once green, safely re-anchor the separately opt-in nested Niri production-host probe to the changed component; then investigate an inner-body-only `Region` with independent real pointer pass-through against an interactive underlay, rather than immediately shrinking the mask. Physical multioutput/hotplug, long-run *whole-shell* resources, visual/animation approval and canonical-wide validation remain open. `stable` untouched.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 centered production geometry 4/4 and focused qualification 8/8; nested host guard refreshed

- Two independent sanitized post-change production QML receipts are **PASS** on exact sources: `docs/aqua-production-geometry-20261001T151747Z-81e30bf2-336726d7ea1d.json` at `336726d7ea1d9523b217fd911db6739aa9242dff` and `docs/aqua-production-geometry-20261001T151838Z-fd6d4452-fca3953264b1.json` at `fca3953264b1fa7a7d6e58ed6ff5300c96f8433b`. Both ran the unchanged four-edge fixture against the updated REAL production `AbyssCompanion.qml` with no runtime anchor override: **4/4 containment PASS**, each mapped clickable-body bounding box/host area ratio **0.637**, no protrusion. Offscreen geometry only; neither receipt measures native pointer pass-through or visual quality.
- Focused receipt `docs/aqua-manual-qualification-20261001T151759Z-19830792-c10b669fa87f.json` on `c10b669fa87ff8b26ed2c1f58a9e9781feb0290d` is **8/8 PASS**: Aqua production and host policy, complete perimeter regression, Rust unit and locked release, exact-build dispatcher version, native production and package metadata. Global canonical remains `not_run` for this receipt, and previous canonical-wide failures are unresolved. The tested Aqua production sources did not change across these receipt SHA transitions.
- Source-guard-only changes to the previously used real Niri opt-in host probes: `c5f04586992b0d7992b43a7b910764b651421dbf` re-anchors `scripts/aqua-manual-production-layer.py` to post-qualification `b5eaf719c5b9d161c862f8e9176b6f4dd3d93739`, preserving its pinned original script/fixture and rejecting later production dependency changes. `cfe5a7eda916e0667825199112b7a6f7b0483e74` and fix-forward `425e334d0b6d735a7ad6ca997dac10c3d2d56a78` update the `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-niri.py` child blob pin and baseline-audit revision for the centered production component. These source-only probe guard changes **have not yet earned fresh local validation or nested Niri execution evidence**. No Aqua rendering, daemon, default, existing running shell or compositor input mask was changed by them.
- Next exact-source gate: from one clean `dev` checkout, run `scripts/test-aqua-production-layer-contract.py` and `scripts/test-aqua-nested-niri-contract.py`, then the explicitly opt-in `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-niri.py --acknowledge-nested-niri` only if the inert contracts pass. Inspect both nested and child `docs/aqua-*.json` receipts and source SHAs. Never infer physical mouse hit-testing from the Niri layer inventory. After PASS, design an independent controlled nested-session real pointer/interactive-underlay test BEFORE changing the complete host input region; later distinct gates remain live visual/motion approval, multi-output/hotplug/reload/suspend, whole-shell long-run resources and canonical global acceptance. Aqua stays default-off, `stable` untouched.

- Preflight hardening before the next local nested test: commit `db6bd1f144cac9379e33a96e09514731099fa555` changes only the child test runner to avoid signalling an already-exited Quickshell owner's potentially reused process-group ID; `ef4316953e2254104741a4f9bd0b780e4c9a7836` adds a no-live-process executable regression for that case; `8243ca5375d85119d455875ac6aff820ed01ef56` pins the nested coordinator to the cleanup-hardened child and its fresh exact baseline. This is deterministic **test tooling only**, not a production feature change. Both inert contracts and the real nested production-host lifecycle must still run on one clean exact source before any fresh PASS claim.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 refreshed nested production PASS; pointer witness and safe geometry staged

- Fresh source-pinned independent nested receipts on `dev`: `docs/aqua-nested-niri-20261001T152505Z-d938e783-24af1766f3eb.json` and `docs/aqua-production-layer-20261001T152511Z-c5413658-24af1766f3eb.json` both record **PASS** against `24af1766f3eb7fc7abb2a381efba962ea51ed42d`. The guarded coordinator used a distinct owned private Niri socket and one nested output, with no preexisting Abyss layer, one mapped actual production PanelWindow, disabled phase with zero private daemon, enabled phase with exactly one private daemon, no unrequested keyboard focus, full layer/process/nested cleanup and unchanged host output count. This qualifies the centered post-fix production host's bounded single-output mapping/lifecycle in the nested environment, **not** physical pointer routing, Aqua visual quality, multioutput or global canonical validation. Its associated inert contracts were prerequisites in the user's one-command runner; do not generalize their PASS beyond the receipt source.
- A new *separate*, not yet executed pointer-test groundwork was committed without changing any production file: `36bb15bd319aa6f0f6d78393bdc14abd75780807` adds `scripts/aqua-fixtures/pointer-underlay/shell.qml`, a dedicated full-output bottom layer that records private real click markers while remaining separate from the production Abyss namespace. `d1092caa4ac05ac486523db2a5941c23e7d59d8d` adds the inert `scripts/aqua-pointer-targets.py` initial top-edge control/body/margin geometry. `88c78958dcbc5f9d90233ae79c862932db7d1c17` adds the inert contract `scripts/test-aqua-pointer-underlay-contract.py`. `d52da3b0c8a798c279b99c817e16b7accdf16f29` documents a strict pointer acceptance matrix in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`. **No actual pointer event has been sent or accepted yet; these new files have no new local execution receipt.**
- Next: implement a dedicated guarded child/coordinator for a real native virtual-pointer test **only on a separately verified nested Niri socket**. Run the inert pointer contract before any actual injection. Start the private underlay and the real production Abyss concurrently on that same output with Aqua `interactive=true` in the enabled phase (prior production mapping probe deliberately used `interactive=false`). Require observed underlay disabled-center and enabled-outside clicks plus independently observed real Aqua-to-daemon click delivery before claiming body hit-test PASS. Host-empty-margin response is diagnostic under the current whole-host mask. If the native virtual-pointer tool or protocol is missing, record `INCONCLUSIVE` and do not inject on the host desktop. Publish only sanitized exact-SHA per-case/cleanup data; raw coordinates and event logs stay local. Do not shrink production Region until this real control matrix, subsequent candidate-mask comparison and click/hover behavior have been qualified. Distinct outstanding gates: canonical-wide failures, live visual/motion approval, real multi-output/hotplug/reload/suspend and whole-shell long-run resource observation. Default-off Aqua; `stable` untouched.


- Follow-up private relay: `f8116f4000b40265648e8a20f0d6f29fa16b1012` adds `scripts/aqua-fixtures/pointer-underlay/companion-relay.py`, a gated test-only stdio relay that forwards unchanged bridge JSON to the **real private inir-companiond** and records private bounded click-event/reaction markers. `1a3e7a7d837e7bcfc82bf2bb8f702355d5475891` adds `scripts/test-aqua-private-relay-contract.py`, an inert fake-backend forwarding/host-identity refusal smoke only; `5bfc6b4f17d4234f8dc86584a74fd2c55b7c57cf` documents the strict distinction in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`. No live pointer or relay receipt yet; next build the isolated nested-only coordinator and child before requesting **one** grouped local command. Do not run separate test commands or claim pointer PASS from an inert fake backend. Keep `stable` and production mask unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 guarded real nested-pointer runner staged; awaiting exact-SHA local probe

- The latest prior actual centered production nested-Niri receipts remain `docs/aqua-nested-niri-20261001T152505Z-d938e783-24af1766f3eb.json` and child `docs/aqua-production-layer-20261001T152511Z-c5413658-24af1766f3eb.json`: PASS on `24af1766f3eb7fc7abb2a381efba962ea51ed42d`. They verified actual production PanelWindow mapping, default-off zero backend, enabled one exact-private Rust daemon, no unwanted keyboard focus and cleanup on one nested output, but **NOT pointer input**.
- The controlled next-stage **REAL pointer runner is now staged on dev**, not yet executed: `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py` is the top-level coordinator (initial `b47f921bf2789dbb7106360fa8aadea624d22fbb` with audited follow-up hardening through `a0af3df733b64b0f21617b7a19693cbf516590d4`); `scripts/aqua-manual-pointer-child.py` builds exact private release Rust and stages isolated production/underlay Quickshell sessions (created `ee0b3bed0f4d1745189f51bcba0c8341906f1fdc`, hardened through `6f5c0a6abc717138e0535716b1f84d510b4fe2b7`). The parent pins reviewed exact blobs of its child and all actual production Aqua/fixture dependencies, verifies distinct owned nested Wayland/Niri sockets, checks one active nested output and no preexisting namespaces, and refuses unreviewed changes. Cleanup is limited to verified owned processes. Production Aqua QML, native source, complete input mask and default-off settings are unchanged.
- The private test child enables Aqua interactively only inside its temporary nested config and uses the `companion-relay.py` fixture to forward unchanged production bridge messages to the REAL privately built `inir-companiond`. It requires actual Rust `present` state before click, disables Aqua for an underlay-center negative control, verifies enabled external underlay pass-through, then requires BOTH a real bridge click and real Rust `happy`/pulse reaction from the Aqua body center without an underlay click. The host-empty-margin observation is diagnostic under the unchanged whole-host mask, not an acceptance claim. It checks no unexpected keyboard focus and revalidates nested Wayland socket before every injection.
- Native input is allowed **only** through an already-installed `wdotool --backend wlr-protocols` within the verified nested session. Missing `wdotool`, unavailable native backend or any uncertain isolation emits `INCONCLUSIVE`; no installation, portal, host-global `uinput` or real desktop fallback. The first probe covers only **one top edge on one nested output**. Physical clicks on other edges, popup non-interference, live host visuals, whole-shell long-run resources, multi-output/hotplug/reload/suspend and unresolved global canonical acceptance remain separate.
- Inert prerequisites on the same clean `dev` source: `scripts/test-aqua-pointer-underlay-contract.py`, `scripts/test-aqua-private-relay-contract.py` (updated to check explicit checkout and real-present markers), and `scripts/test-aqua-nested-pointer-contract.py` (created `269eace9bc019f71dbe8cbdf5ee6bcd9d4a49be5`, guarded safety followup through `4a59cc0c81dcd49e2540df13c4c93f653bed2ae6`). The parser/provenance source was inspected through GitHub but **none of these three new gates or the actual pointer runner has fresh local execution evidence**.
- Next: run exactly those three inert prerequisites, then (only on PASS) `python3 scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py --acknowledge-nested-pointer` from one clean fast-forward-only `dev` checkout as ONE grouped local command. Check the unique `docs/aqua-pointer-acceptance-*.json` receipt on `dev`, exact source SHA, all control cases and owned cleanup. If no receipt appears, do NOT rerun blindly; inspect available evidence/STOP first. Do not narrow the production Region without the actual observed control matrix followed by separate candidate-mask comparison. `stable` untouched.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 bounded nested pointer child-group timeout hardening

- Before executing the previously staged real pointer coordinator, source audit found a cleanup risk: on a bounded parent timeout, terminating only the owned Python child PID could leave an in-group Cargo/virtual-input subprocess alive. Source-only commit `42fca65f2eba1f5d8202649123f8fb31b97db9bc` adds `stop_owned_child_group` to `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py`: it SIGTERMs (and boundedly SIGKILLs if needed) the child's *verified live* process group, while refusing a group signal after the leader already exited to avoid reused PGIDs. The self revision guard is advanced from four to five reviewed commits. Commit `3eb3202d7f8d3ec95d87b7e80db71b1b71137136` adds an **inert** mock test for both exited and hung child-group cleanup in `scripts/test-aqua-nested-pointer-contract.py`. This is test-tool cleanup hardening only, NOT an observed local/desktop PASS. Production Aqua QML, daemon, complete host input mask and defaults are unchanged.
- Latest inspection found **zero** committed `docs/aqua-pointer-acceptance-*.json` receipts. Next run the three current-source inert pointer contracts (underlay, private relay, nested pointer) sequentially, and only after all succeed invoke the explicitly authorized coordinator `python3 scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py --acknowledge-nested-pointer` from a clean fast-forward-only `dev` checkout in **one terminal command**. The runner publishes one SHA-pinned sanitized receipt, with `INCONCLUSIVE` (not PASS) when `wdotool` or its forced native `wlr-protocols` backend is unavailable. Do not automatically rerun on an uncertain result; read receipt/current Git state first. Subsequent gates remain physical other-edge controls, popup interactions, long-run shell resources, multioutput/hotplug/reload/suspend, visual motion and canonical-wide validation. Never enable Aqua by default or mutate `stable`.


- Underlay inert false-positive repair: user's grouped local run stopped at the FIRST inert safety test with `AssertionError` on `assert "AbyssPerimeter" not in fixture`. Source verification found that `scripts/aqua-fixtures/pointer-underlay/shell.qml` mentions `AbyssPerimeter` only in a `//` explanatory comment and does NOT instantiate/import the production QML. Commit `cf86274889fcb27108c9aa7b5421d187011cf2d5` corrects **only the inert contract** `scripts/test-aqua-pointer-underlay-contract.py` to check uncommented QML statements for a real Abyss import/instantiation. The actual underlay fixture, production code, real nested pointer runner and all source guard pins remain unchanged. A GitHub-side logic check confirmed the actual fixture and comment-only case are accepted and synthetic production import/instantiation are rejected; this is NOT an exact-SHA local test PASS. The previous grouped command stopped BEFORE private relay contract or live nested pointer execution; do not claim those gates or a pointer report passed. Resume only after clean `dev` fast-forward with all three current inert contracts, then explicitly opt in to the real nested runner; inspect its unique sanitized receipt and classify `INCONCLUSIVE` rather than asserting PASS if no native backend is available.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 real pointer preflight tool missing; native-only alternative staged

- The user's grouped command passed far enough to publish the real
  `docs/aqua-pointer-acceptance-20261001T155651Z-c552449b-304d6ab601b1.json`
  receipt on exact source `304d6ab601b130c11756de2f4ac7059cdda5507b`.
  The receipt is **INCONCLUSIVE** with
  `native_wdotool_missing_no_input_injected`; its `observation` is
  null. No real pointer event occurred, no Aqua input-mask failure
  or PASS is established, and nothing in production was changed.
- The source-only alternative keeps preferred exact native
  `wdotool --backend wlr-protocols` and accepts already-installed
  `wlrctl` only if `wdotool` is absent. The latter speaks the
  native virtual-pointer protocol but moves **relative**, not
  absolute; `scripts/aqua-manual-pointer-child.py` now uses a
  candidate origin-reset plus relative target, verifies the
  owned nested endpoints **before each command**, and treats failed
  relative input controls as **INCONCLUSIVE** until the real
  independent underlay / production bridge / Rust reaction matrix
  establishes the physical hit. The only source changes are in
  test tooling: child commits `666d6d18d206a92a5d6b28d2800eb9e0e7156898`,
  `0f22292de807744af0220356c96e66c71010fc33`, parent
  `5f3b777457091bab8ed8c47be31512c1f915fd97`,
  `97c2a4e5577759fcfb731890792e6a99135fbc66`,
  and updated inert contract
  `0b716fa8f5011a29051aae2d4486869f2633351f`.
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` now records
  the limitations and the original inconclusive receipt. No new
  local evidence has been collected for this optional backend yet.
- Next command for the user: fetch/fast-forward from clean `dev`,
  run the three inert pointer safety contracts in order, and run
  the explicit nested pointer coordinator only when the machine
  already has at least one of `wdotool` or `wlrctl`. If neither
  exists, STOP with only a short missing-tool message: do not
  install dependencies automatically or repeat the known
  missing-input receipt. Check the next unique sanitized pointer
  receipt on GitHub rather than asking the user for raw logs.
  A physical top-edge PASS, if observed, is only one nested output;
  four-edge physical pointer behavior, mask change comparison,
  full-shell resource behavior, live visuals, actual multi-output,
  reload/suspend and canonical-wide acceptance remain separate.
  Default-off Aqua and `stable` stay unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 all three inert pointer safety checks PASS; local CLI unavailable

- The user's latest one-command local run printed **all three new inert contracts PASS**: `AQUA_POINTER_UNDERLAY_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_RELAY_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS` and `AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS`. Its next **CLI availability** gate stopped with `Neither wdotool nor wlrctl is installed; no pointer input attempted`. The script did **not** invoke `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py` this time, and therefore produced no new real-pointer JSON receipt. Do NOT count these inert tests as actual pointer validation, and do NOT repeat the exact same unavailable-input probe.
- Verify and use one native-only virtual-pointer CLI that is already packaged by the user's distro; `wlrctl` is available in official Debian, Ubuntu and Fedora packaging, with documented native relative `pointer move <dx> <dy>` and `pointer click` actions. In Niri, access to its own Wayland socket admits `wlr-virtual-pointer`, but this does NOT license input into the current desktop. An explicit **user-approved** OS package installation may be suggested separately from tests; never silently download/build/install, never modify a package manager without informed approval, and never substitute host-global uinput. If the distro has no verified package, stop and collect non-sensitive distro/package-manager information, rather than guessing a third-party repository. Underlay control failures with the relative backend must remain `INCONCLUSIVE`.
- When a verified native CLI is available, resume the clean-`dev` single-command sequence: three inert contracts and then the opt-in `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py --acknowledge-nested-pointer`, which creates its owned nested session and publishes only sanitized exact-source evidence. Production code/mask/default-off behavior and `stable` remain unchanged. Physical top-edge click, four-edge input, popup interactions, visual quality, multioutput/reload/suspend, long-run full-shell resources and unresolved canonical-wide acceptance remain independent open gates.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 Arch Linux: Cargo-only native pointer dependency

- Maintainer confirms Arch Linux: one clean-`dev` grouped run on
  `8f2bcb3f38065ca17e8914befd3d9578cb60e9ee` logged all three
  pointer inert contracts **PASS**, then stopped at `No verified wlrctl
  package found for Arch Linux`. Neither `wdotool` nor `wlrctl`
  was installed and NO new real pointer event/report occurred.
- Public upstream `cushycush/wdotool` explicitly supports
  `cargo install wdotool` from crates.io, plus native
  `--backend wlr-protocols` absolute `mousemove` and `click`
  commands. It can be installed with `cargo install --locked wdotool
  --root ~/.local` as the normal user, **only after the maintainer
  explicitly approves building third-party code**. The next single
  local command must first fast-forward clean `dev` and run all three
  inert contracts, detect a currently available native pointer CLI,
  otherwise explain the Cargo source/install destination and require
  interactive explicit yes before executing `cargo install`. Add
  `~/.local/bin` to PATH only for this shell. Never run Cargo as
  root, pipe downloaded scripts into the shell, use AUR without
  review, allow the uinput/portal input fallback, or test the live
  host directly. The nested runner itself forces
  `--backend wlr-protocols` and validates a distinct owned Niri
  socket before input. Any missing protocol remains INCONCLUSIVE.
- Pointer acceptance is NOT yet achieved: inspect a freshly
  published `docs/aqua-pointer-acceptance-*.json` exact-source receipt
  before any claims or changes to Aqua's current whole-host Region.
  Keep production QML, native code, default-off and `stable`
  untouched; global canonical, physical other-edge input,
  multioutput/hotplug, visual quality and long-running shell
  resource qualification remain separate.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 first real pointer matrix failure and coordinate-qualified rerun

- Latest exact-source **real** nested pointer receipt:
  `docs/aqua-pointer-acceptance-20261001T161301Z-8af536c9-115ab32a9825.json`
  on `115ab32a98251453edc76c84bdc8558068186aab`
  has overall **FAILED** status. One compositor-owned nested output
  and private source-built real Rust backend were verified; disabled
  candidate-center underlay control and enabled exterior underlay
  control both passed **by event counts**. The enabled candidate
  body-center click was instead observed by the full-output
  underlay (`underlay_not_clicked=false`), with zero real bridge
  click marker and zero real Rust reaction. Production layer, underlay,
  private daemon and nested compositor cleanup all passed, and host
  output count stayed unchanged. **Critical evidence limitation**:
  event counts do not prove that the native pointer actually moved
  to the requested candidate coordinates. Do not label this proven
  production input-mask failure or narrow the Region yet.
- Source-only follow-up
  `a83f630f7f4bdc73953bc75b7b14b888e6544219` adds bounded
  actual underlay-event coordinate verification to the private
  child: disabled-center and enabled-exterior now must produce
  exactly one matched left-click within six logical pixels of
  their requested point; the enabled-body underlay event is
  independently tested for positional alignment. Wrong/missing
  or ambiguous positions are **INCONCLUSIVE**, not production
  regressions. Only allow further mask/host analysis once
  underlay coordinates corroborate the target. Raw locations
  remain local private logs, while sanitized reports publish
  bounded alignment labels only. `a784b3db6157d4c05368fee0ec79925a1a51f468`
  re-reviews/pins the exact child and increments the coordinator's
  self guard; `03d237620ada9dd170d31163ef6081bd40a66042`
  adds a synthetic inert-parser contract and updated pins.
  The technical investigation is in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  (updated `e4553da088fa1bdde5b2c0991f26ff835f6fb96e`).
- Await **one clean exact-SHA local grouped run** of the three
  inert contracts and the explicit owned nested pointer runner
  using the now-available already-installed native CLI. If the
  next pointer receipt shows both controls aligned but the
  enabled body underlay aligned too, investigate **runtime host
  visibility/activation versus compositor input mask** with a
  separate, read-only or test-only fixture before editing
  production. If coordinates are off target, diagnose native
  pixel-vs-logical-output mapping instead of changing Aqua.
  Full canonical, visual/animation signoff, physical four-edge
  pointer and multioutput/hotplug, resource long-run and
  reload/suspend remain unqualified. Stable and production
  input mask/default-off remain unchanged.


- Follow-up sanitized backend provenance: `6670066439c8899b42ba528e5cf81f9b71ce9ee4`
projects the allowlisted actual child pointer backend
(`forced_wlr_protocols_wdotool` or
`native_relative_wlrctl_unverified`) into the main sanitized
receipt, without host paths, and raises the reviewed coordinator
self-revision count from eight to nine. The inert contract assertion
was added in `1de19ca38f1738e0167b01a169c63f67d43cf1a4`.
The technical design note records this. No new real pointer receipt
after the prior FAILED source `115ab32a9825` has yet been inspected:
the next grouped local run must validate the current inert tests and
the stricter real coordinate-witness matrix before any Aqua
production input change.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 coordinate-qualified top-edge pointer PASS; private candidate comparison awaiting local test

- The latest verified source-pinned REAL nested Niri pointer receipt is now
  `docs/aqua-pointer-acceptance-20261001T161911Z-4d87f846-391d8e81d461.json`,
  `source_sha=391d8e81d4617a6dbdb1199d009db4e0970ce073`,
  **PASS**. Its forced native `wdotool --backend wlr-protocols`
  body-disabled and enabled-exterior controls independently reported
  `target_alignment=matched`; its enabled body hit produced NO underlay
  click, exactly one actual bridge click and a real private native Rust
  happy/pulse acknowledgment. Verified clean single-output nested
  identity, namespace isolation, all owned layer/process/compositor
  cleanup and unchanged host output count. The prior count-only
  `FAILED` receipt is diagnostic history, NOT proof that this
  newly coordinate-qualified run failed. The current full host
  mask's empty internal margin did not pass through to underlay;
  it also did not accidentally trigger a body click.
- With that baseline PASS, the next priority is a separate source-only
  **PRIVATE top-edge size=1 candidate mask A/B**, NEVER a premature
  production mask edit. Commit
  `e3da0c57264cb44f26045e285f14b22a301a06ba` adds
  `scripts/aqua-private-mask-candidate.py`, which guards and
  substitutes precisely ONE reviewed Aqua Region in a PRIVATE
  shadowed `AbyssPerimeter.qml` outside the checkout, leaving
  all other modules linked unchanged. Child commits
  `11ecc21ad115fd0c683f3c7ce0c2e003e58f256d` and
  `975482cd8a49475d9eb622d7b38c49aa601ec2bf`
  add a same-owned-nested-compositor real full-mask control
  followed by a separately launched private candidate.
  The candidate must preserve correct-coordinate exterior
  pass-through, genuine body bridge/Rust click and obtain a
  positive correctly aligned underlay click at the formerly
  blocked empty host margin. All controls, phase handoff,
  cleanup and one absolute native pointer source must pass.
- `244b6a95a485ff669506614958832e2715cb3e3c`
  provides a separate explicit coordinator argument
  `--acknowledge-nested-pointer-candidate` and distinct
  `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-*.json` sanitized receipt.
  It pins the new helper/child and ten audited parent revisions,
  leaving the existing production-pointer opt-in unchanged.
  `b705c2b224ff432e06e4268b25fb8ba7d84626f3`
  introduces a NEW wholly inert private-mask staging/source
  contract, and
  `55e191bb119be6e7f7d47150dff8876db0fb6fe8`
  re-anchors the existing pointer inert contract.
  The technical details and limitations are in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` updated
  `2700abe1f65be9b98a13e6eeeb2c15b1de6c3c77`.
- **NEXT LOCAL GATE**, not yet executed: on one clean
  fast-forward-only `dev` checkout and with already-installed
  user-space `wdotool`, run the three existing inert pointer
  contracts AND `scripts/test-aqua-private-mask-candidate-contract.py`,
  then ONLY if all PASS invoke
  `python3 scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py --acknowledge-nested-pointer-candidate`
  in the SAME grouped terminal command. Inspect the unique
  `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-*.json` receipt; an inert PASS
  alone is not real candidate approval. If a candidate
  QML load fails, analyze the private scoped diagnostic without
  guessing the input mask. Keep `stable`, production Aqua,
  default-off and complete host Region unchanged until separate
  candidate PASS plus later four-edge, popup/hover, live visual,
  real multioutput and canonical/global qualification.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 top private mask A/B PASS; bottom trial source staged

- The NEW real private top-edge input-mask comparison receipt is
  `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-20261001T165308Z-a3bc585f-124f02155679.json`,
  exact source `124f02155679949e60a810e54a9c216fbfd2fabe`:
  **PASS** using forced native `wdotool` in one verified owned
  nested Niri output. The unchanged production full-host mask
  passed aligned disabled-center and exterior controls, actual
  body bridge and private Rust response, while its empty internal
  host margin did NOT pass through. The shadow-only narrow
  rectangular top-size1 BBOX then passed its independently
  aligned exterior control, genuine bridge/Rust body click and
  **positive aligned** empty-margin underlay pass-through
  without false body activation. Distinct nested endpoints,
  all private process/Wayland layer cleanup and unchanged
  host output count passed. The shipped Aqua production mask
  and default-off settings remain unchanged; `stable` untouched.
- The next separately qualified edge is **BOTTOM**, not yet
  accepted. Four-edge postchange offscreen geometry from
  `docs/aqua-production-geometry-20261001T151838Z-fd6d4452-fca3953264b1.json`
  establishes source-measured clickable BBOXes ONLY. Source
  `62c483451d91c7b0e5e1f1184fd84f8b04443c14`
  adds conservative four-edge pointer targets without
  modifying the old top function.
  `5b928b852664e8369f74fa17243e78cc92a402c8`
  changes ONLY the private candidate generator to select
  76x92 on top/bottom and rotated 92x76 on left/right at
  size=1, refusing unreviewed geometry/source. Child
  `4e32eaa1f874540b5f71ceca34c5a4b697734568`
  adds `candidate-mask-bottom` alongside the preserved
  original top opt-in. Parent
  `3309b00ac035ff5944283073aef8e181382339e8`
  pins all changed source, raises the audited self-revision
  count to 11, adds `--acknowledge-nested-pointer-candidate-bottom`,
  and publishes its unique `docs/aqua-mask-bottom-*.json`
  in a separate bottom-specific scope.
  Contracts `4d5080b87951885e40b920d6e603a5e064f35cb9`
  and `6b210355f794d2490059f5de46251ece32f313ea`
  review static four-edge bounds, preserve top equivalence,
  re-pin the child and check bottom-only entry controls.
  Full design/limits in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` update
  `dd677e30a08f4cd78fb999add13e7487d9a1c0e9`.
- **Next one-command local gate:** from a clean fast-forward-only
  `dev` root with already-installed user `wdotool`, run
  the three old inert pointer contracts PLUS
  `scripts/test-aqua-private-mask-candidate-contract.py`.
  Only if all PASS, invoke the original private top
  A/B comparison (new dynamic generator regression) and
  require explicit observed `AQUA_REAL_POINTER_RESULT: pass`.
  Only then invoke the separately authorized bottom A/B
  on a new owned nested Niri compositor and check its
  independent explicit PASS. Both publish sanitized
  different-prefix exact-source receipts, never raw
  coordinates or host-global input. Read new receipts on
  `dev` before deciding how to extend to right/left.
  Do not modify real production Region or `stable` from
  inert or top-only success. Subsequent physical side edges,
  popup/hover, actual multi-output/hotplug, reload/suspend,
  whole-shell long-run resources, visuals and canonical-wide
  validation remain outstanding.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-01 dynamic top A/B remap off-target; read-only retro diagnosis

- Local clean temporary-clone run **DID publish** the new report
  `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-20261001T170950Z-105fd7a8-1518db798d10.json`
  on exact source `1518db798d1012592cdbceb29115cceb72cffd9b`:
  **INCONCLUSIVE**, not FAIL or PASS. Four baseline real
  full-production checks succeeded (disabled-body and
  enabled-exterior actual coordinates matched, actual body click
  reached bridge and private real Rust happy/pulse, full-host
  empty margin remained blocked). After baseline cleaned,
  the FIRST newly remapped private dynamic-candidate exterior
  control registered a real underlay click at the WRONG
  location (`target_alignment=off_target`).
  The runner stopped before candidate body and margin
  checks, and before any bottom-edge run. It verified
  private nested endpoints, process/layer cleanup and
  unchanged host output count. The older `124f0215...`
  top-size1 private A/B **PASS** remains separate
  historical evidence; this new run has not requalified
  the now-dynamic four-edge candidate source.
- Added **read-only local retrospective** diagnosis
  `scripts/aqua-private-pointer-drift-diagnostic.py`
  commit `55907217e8e1a18d9ae74cc5b129578db45f1aa8`,
  with symlink-rejection correction
  `a0f1e06f2f934298312e19a2df74563e604bc395`,
  and synthetic inert parser contract
  `scripts/test-aqua-private-pointer-drift-diagnostic.py`
  commit `06c640e1ee1385e75524c6c3eb2a3650c2ffa031`.
  It accepts only the existing exact report sequence,
  reads the corresponding owned PRIVATE previous-run
  underlay log on the user's host, compares baseline
  and candidate exterior witness locations against
  each other (identical target expected), and prints
  only coarse drift magnitude/direction and possible
  stale-disabled-center categorization. No raw
  coordinates, new physical pointer input, new
  dependencies, user config, Git checkout or production
  source changes. Detailed constraints are in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`,
  updated `ea8152e80104f1169aa0c56f16c6942281527efb`.
- **NEXT ONE-COMMAND LOCAL GATE**: from any original
  Hadalis Git checkout, fetch the current remote `dev`
  WITHOUT merging/rebasing/resetting the user's
  divergent local `dev`. Stage ONLY that read-only
  diagnostic, its inert synthetic contract and the
  one public sanitized target report in a new
  permission-restricted temporary directory using
  `git show origin/dev:...`. Run the inert test,
  then classify the user's existing local private
  Niri-session underlay witness (if retained).
  Capture ONLY the short categorical output. If
  source log is absent or input count ambiguous,
  report INCONCLUSIVE and design a new isolated
  instrumentation gate; do not guess. Avoid another
  expensive full Rust/Niri pointer rerun until
  this existing evidence is read.
  Do not increase mouse-target tolerance, call
  host-global injection, make production changes,
  or promote bottom/right/left as accepted.
  Production/default-off and `stable` stay
  unchanged; all other four-edge and full-system
  qualification remains separate.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 old private top pointer log: sanitized autonomous publication staged

- As of review of `dev`, the only new dynamic private
  top candidate run is still
  `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-20261001T170950Z-105fd7a8-1518db798d10.json`,
  source `1518db798d1012592cdbceb29115cceb72cffd9b`,
  **INCONCLUSIVE** at the FIRST post-remap candidate
  exterior witness: `target_alignment=off_target`.
  Its four real full-production controls passed and
  all owned private compositor, underlay, production
  layer and Rust cleanup passed. A separate older top
  candidate PASS still exists but did NOT test the
  latest dynamic four-edge BBOX generator. Bottom has
  no independent real acceptance report.
- Latest additional source-only progress:
  `scripts/aqua-private-pointer-drift-publish.py`
  commit `dc06dd36aabc688f1945205bb4a814c58f91d90e`
  supports one EXPLICIT, input-free retrospective
  classification and Git publication in a permission-private
  TEMPORARY clone of `dev`; never modifies the
  maintainer's potentially divergent original local branch.
  Its only imported measurement logic is the previously
  reviewed source-pinned
  `scripts/aqua-private-pointer-drift-diagnostic.py`
  blob `91c2207e7d96aa8852f6d6f8df0ea1cb28d647d2`;
  it also pins the exact public original report blob.
  It reads the prior run's private underlay log by
  the known session ID; it requires an unambiguous
  three-event and exact-source sequence; it emits
  only reviewed categorical axis/magnitude/relative
  direction, one prior-center-proximity boolean and
  explicit no-new-input/no-production-change fields.
  Its unique fixed public result path is
  `docs/aqua-pointer-drift-20261001T170950Z-105fd7a8-1518db798d10.json`.
  Concurrent Git pushes are handled ONLY by guarded,
  non-forced replay of that single unpublished
  sanitized commit in the temporary clone. If
  old logs were not retained or source changes
  invalidate exact blobs, stop INCONCLUSIVE rather
  than guess.
- The publisher's inert/test-only payload and
  source guard contract is
  `scripts/test-aqua-private-pointer-drift-publish-contract.py`
  created `fbd1e709b0b64046afa9e619426e409973dce59b`.
  Existing diagnostic inert parser contract must
  PASS in the same local invocation before any
  Git publication. The technical design appendage
  is in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  updated `87c5c295bfb1ba0c8cc97d66b1bb24a8fe32d828`.
- **NEXT LOCAL GATE:** one clean permission-private
  temp `dev` clone outside the user's original
  checkout; run BOTH no-input inert drift
  contracts, then explicitly invoke
  `python3 scripts/aqua-private-pointer-drift-publish.py --publish-existing-top-off-target`
  if they pass. Inspect only the resulting
  unique sanitized public report on `dev`.
  This avoids another expensive Rust rebuild and
  real Niri pointer run before the existing log
  evidence is consumed.
  Independently, external wdotool documentation
  confirms a possible transient virtual-device
  lifecycle variable and documents `wdotool prime`,
  but this is just a hypothesis. Do not change
  injection timing, install new tools, enable
  host-global injection, run a blind second
  pointer attempt or qualify bottom until
  old-log evidence or a new separately
  authorized bounded instrumented test exists.
  Current production Region, default-off and
  `stable` remain unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 verified large two-axis drift; discriminating physical pre-remap witness staged

- The explicit read-only retrospective report was actually published:
  `docs/aqua-pointer-drift-20261001T170950Z-105fd7a8-1518db798d10.json`
  on source `5164395aea401bcfcd79fa8e74622d34fe5fceb5`.
  Its exact pinned prior-run underlay witnesses verify that
  the same requested exterior point was hit **96+
  pixels off-target in maximum-axis deviation** after
  the private candidate stage mapped. Both axes
  shifted (horizontal negative, vertical positive)
  and the event did **not** land near the original
  disabled-center location. This is real old-log
  categorical evidence, NOT a new pointer run,
  diagnosis of wdotool's internal cause, or
  acceptance of the new dynamic four-edge BBOX.
  Previous same-source full production controls
  passed, then first dynamic candidate exterior
  witness was off-target, so the new top-edge run
  remains **INCONCLUSIVE**; no bottom receipt exists.
- Source-only follow-up adds an independently
  corroborated discriminating physical gate, not
  retries/tolerance workarounds. Child source
  `5b79c09aabb2f5b50895d0d4c0b38c86cffe4248`
  now verifies the owned Niri single output's
  logical geometry, scale and current mode before
  EVERY native virtual-pointer command. After
  qualifying the full-host real production controls
  and fully stopping/unmapping it, but BEFORE
  mapping a new private candidate, it requires
  one exact-target underlay exterior click
  `after_baseline_unmap_exterior_underlay_control`.
  This separates pointer drift that began during
  baseline teardown from drift observed only after
  candidate remapping, without attributing causality
  prematurely. If intermediate click is off-target,
  stop **INCONCLUSIVE**, do not map candidate or
  claim mask failure. If aligned, proceed with
  the previous separately witnessed candidate
  exterior/body/margin checks. Any output
  geometry/topology change stops the test
  inconclusively before the click.
  No changes to native backend invocation,
  no new dependencies, no host-global injection,
  no silent retries and no changed tolerance.
- Parent source-guard update
  `3ede937c9b70284de76dcb5fc1724abe0da09500`
  pins the revised child and advances 11 to
  12 reviewed parent revisions. Existing inert
  tests `scripts/test-aqua-nested-pointer-contract.py`
  (commit `7a4a935afa99a1712bbeba7e4e7d0928de0b01c4`)
  and `scripts/test-aqua-private-mask-candidate-contract.py`
  (commit `485cc1ec307980c9cc07af1ecccc7ea5ad75462a`)
  were updated to prove pure invalid geometry
  rejection, strict child blob pins, and mandatory
  intermediate witness source. Full technical
  rationale in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  commit `7bcadfd1b06eef39afa4d597d5c481c4b55137d9`.
- **NEXT LOCAL GATE, not yet run:** because the
  original dev checkout previously diverged, use
  ONE new permission-private temporary clean dev
  clone (never reset/rebase/merge the original).
  Run the four standard inert pointer contracts;
  if all PASS, run ONLY the fresh real dynamic
  top private A/B with the pre-remap witness
  on that independently verified owned nested
  Niri output and read the new exact-source
  sanitized top report on `dev`. If top
  now fully PASSes including intermediate
  control, a SEPARATE bottom-edge test could
  be authorized after reviewing that top
  evidence (avoid automatically running
  bottom while investigating drift). If
  off-target BEFORE candidate mapping,
  investigate native pointer/device vs
  baseline lifecycle with the private
  phase-specific log, and do not modify
  production. If only off-target AFTER
  mapping, investigate transient input
  device and new layer/output mapping as
  competing hypotheses, not production
  mask defect. The upstream-documented
  `wdotool prime` option remains untested;
  don't enable it without isolated evidence.
  Existing shipped whole-host Region,
  Rust backend, Aqua default-off,
  `stable`, and any physical four-edge/
  full canonical acceptance remain unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 dynamic top with pre-remap witness REAL PASS; bottom next

- The new independently source-pinned
  `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-20261001T173129Z-ce33db3c-8efa0b7d7341.json`,
  `source_sha=8efa0b7d73418af9fc52b117199e2a691e0158ac`,
  is **REAL PASS** for the private dynamic candidate
  **TOP edge, size=1, one owned nested Niri output**.
  The unchanged old full production mask passed separate
  disabled-body and enabled-exterior exact-coordinate
  underlay controls, true enabled-body bridge/Rust
  happy/pulse without underlay click, and observed
  blocked empty margin without false body activation.
  After fully unmapped old production and Rust,
  the newly added `after_baseline_unmap_exterior_underlay_control`
  independently clicked the SAME exterior target
  with `target_alignment=matched`. The newly
  mapped dynamic private top mask then separately
  passed correctly aligned exterior, real
  bridge/Rust body and **positive matched**
  empty-host-margin pass-through without false
  body activation. One-output nested endpoints,
  all owned processes/layers/compositor cleanup
  and original host output count passed.
  No source or host config was changed by the probe.
- Keep the previous
  `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-20261001T170950Z-105fd7a8-1518db798d10.json`
  INCONCLUSIVE. Its real old-log diagnosis showed
  large off-target drift in both axes at first
  candidate exterior; latest successful trial
  proves capability on that new source but
  cannot claim that transient cause is fixed.
- **NEXT LOCAL ACTION:** a SINGLE NEW physical
  **BOTTOM** private candidate A/B test using
  existing separately allowed coordinator flag
  `--acknowledge-nested-pointer-candidate-bottom`
  in an exclusively fresh permission-private dev
  clone. Run four inert pointer safety/geometry
  contracts first; fail closed on any test or
  source audit failure. Publish/read distinct
  `docs/aqua-mask-bottom-*.json` and inspect
  its child checks, real backend, output isolation,
  genuine bridge/Rust, intermediary witness
  and complete cleanup before moving to left/right.
  Do NOT automatically run side edges before
  inspecting bottom receipt. Technical analysis
  and complete prior-run evidence in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  (latest checkpoint commit
  `560948038d08307effee1ff9a3203ad8d1991acd`).
  Real production mask, default-off, `stable`,
  visuals/popup, multioutput/hotplug/scale,
  long-run/lifecycle and canonical-wide validation
  remain unchanged/unqualified.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 real bottom PASS; right independent A/B now staged

- New exact-source independently real PASS on
  `docs/aqua-mask-bottom-20261001T173542Z-10d599c4-9ac701f650dc.json`,
  source `9ac701f650dce381487fa00a56f24520c5c83289`,
  **BOTTOM** dynamic private BBOX candidate scale=1
  on one verified newly owned Niri output with forced
  absolute native wdotool. Every expected baseline,
  post-baseline-unmap target witness and independent
  candidate exterior, bridge/real-Rust body and
  positive empty-margin pass-through check passed.
  The old production full-host margin remained
  blocked; true Aqua body responses never leaked
  to the underlay; all owned layers, private Rust
  processes and the nested compositor stopped,
  and host outputs were unchanged. The distinct
  latest dynamic TOP private candidate real PASS
  remains `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-20261001T173129Z-ce33db3c-8efa0b7d7341.json`.
  The previous dynamic TOP off-target
  INCONCLUSIVE trial and its categorical
  two-axis drift evidence remain unresolved
  reliability observations, not proof that
  new wdotool timing fixes are necessary.
- Dedicated right-side private trial has been
  SOURCE-STAGED, **not physically executed**.
  Original source-measured right host/BBOX is
  98x112 / (x=3,y=18,w=92,h=76), already
  pure geometry-checked by the existing four-edge
  inert helper; the existing PRIVATE dynamic
  source generator selects a centered 92x76
  side-edge rectangle. New child commit
  `555d735f2a99fd18b7588d757810c009e5ebfea2`
  adds ONLY `candidate-mask-right` explicit
  mode using the same guarded actual production
  host, exact-coordinate underlay controls and
  real Rust body response. Parent commit
  `a86e2284907207bb0811a820298e5bd57bcfd3ed`
  pins the new child blob, advances audited
  parent revision count from 12 to 13,
  adds the explicit
  `--acknowledge-nested-pointer-candidate-right`
  option and publishes a new separate
  `docs/aqua-mask-right-*.json` scope/receipt
  without modifying top/bottom/production modes.
  Updated inert contracts are commits
  `ef65b9483b78cba5b6f0c7bcbff55593cd7078dc`
  and `b627e658fb4e4a53dc07a967c0d19a96c96d45f1`.
  Full technical acceptance history is in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  updated `674879bebb8c660fda55ebd5380d3fda28fe1285`.
- Additional inert RIGHT shadow-staging contract
  `6f11029cf852079396c37e7a9ea71dce16747eae`
  independently writes/validates a private right-edge
  `AbyssPerimeter.qml` shadow and right-edge
  scale=1 isolated config while asserting the
  shipped production source stays unchanged.
  This is SOURCE-STAGED, not compositor acceptance.
- **NEXT SINGLE LOCAL GATE**: from fresh
  permission-private clean dev clone, run
  four existing inert Aqua pointer contracts
  first and then ONLY the new explicit
  RIGHT dynamic private candidate A/B
  on its own newly owned nested Niri.
  Require unique source-pin and full parent
  production dependency audit, observed
  absolute native backend, eight real witness
  checks, cleanup and publication of a
  distinct sanitized
  `docs/aqua-mask-right-*.json` receipt.
  Do not automatically try LEFT yet:
  first read, validate and debug the independent
  RIGHT result. If positional witness misses,
  classify as INCONCLUSIVE and do not mislabel
  as production-mask defect or silently retry.
  Stable and shipped production Region/default-off
  remain unchanged. LEFT physical trial,
  nonrectangular silhouette, popups/hover,
  live visual/multioutput/fractional scale,
  suspend/reload/hotplug/lifecycle and
  canonical-wide qualification are pending.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 right real A/B PASS; left isolated candidate gate staged

- New independently published real RIGHT side scale=1
  PRIVATE dynamic BBOX A/B PASS in
  `docs/aqua-mask-right-20261001T174248Z-cd6a3010-cdbe02bbcd61.json`,
  source `cdbe02bbcd61720f07852fd7eb62929d14004188`.
  All eight phase controls and single owned nested
  output/process/layer/Rust cleanup passed with
  forced native absolute wdotool, including separate
  old production exact-coordinate body/Rust controls,
  unmap-before-remap exterior target, and the
  independent private candidate's correctly
  aligned exterior, real body bridge/Rust,
  and positive margin pass-through without false
  activation. TOP and BOTTOM have separate
  real PRIVATE dynamic mask PASS reports.
  The previous large two-axis transient TOP
  off-target observation remains unresolved;
  these successes do not prove lifetime reliability.
- Separate private LEFT-side mode is now
  SOURCE-STAGED only; NOT physically accepted.
  Child commit
  `57d81d35e1e0f6543f61195f275eba5cd5f0a982`
  adds explicit `candidate-mask-left` using
  existing source-measured vertical 98x112 host
  / (3,18,92,76) rotated body geometry,
  existing exact after-unmap witness, private
  actual Rust and real producer A/B controls.
  Parent commit
  `5e2ca4470c04926b7200df89b730bded154eed7b`
  pins exact changed child and 14 audited
  parent revisions, adds ONLY the explicit
  `--acknowledge-nested-pointer-candidate-left`
  and publishes sanitized
  `docs/aqua-mask-left-*.json` with separate
  left-only scope. All top, bottom, right
  and original production modes remain.
  Inert contracts
  `db97e763d244a98ba6a351b3568658255749b7fa`
  and `ccfbe7e947e82c3865651f6aeaf90dbbd1a07c20`
  pin the new child/parent left-only markers,
  and independently stage a PRIVATE
  left-edge side BBOX QML/config while
  asserting unchanged real production source.
  Technical details in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  latest left staging checkpoint
  `d54fc99cd2e2e7b32ae591112b7c434c76e72b43`.
- **NEXT SINGLE LOCAL GATE**: user launches one
  fresh clean permission-restricted temporary
  `dev` clone, never touches any
  original potentially divergent `dev`
  checkout; four inert Aqua pointer contracts
  must pass, then ONLY new explicit real
  LEFT candidate A/B on a newly owned
  isolated nested Niri, with independent
  matched underlay controls, genuine bridge/
  private Rust body response, positive
  empty-margin pass-through and verified
  cleanup. Read published unique exact-source
  `docs/aqua-mask-left-*.json` first;
  FAILED/INCONCLUSIVE cannot qualify left.
  After all four edges achieve private
  pointer PASS, NEXT scope is precise
  curved silhouette/input region design,
  hover and popup, actual visuals,
  multimonitor/hotplug/fractional scale,
  lifecycle/reload/suspend, and
  canonical-wide/long-run validation.
  Do not silently swap the shipped full-host
  Region for a rectangular private test
  BBOX. Leave shipped Aqua default-off,
  real production Region and `stable`
  untouched before further evidence.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 first left physical gate INCONCLUSIVE; five private witness analysis next

- Exact-source REAL LEFT edge single-output,
  scale=1 private candidate report
  `docs/aqua-mask-left-20261001T175020Z-5a11aa42-5b72e0e3294c.json`
  source `5b72e0e3294c32276c306b3c6911fd9fa4e79fb1`
  was independently published as **INCONCLUSIVE**,
  NOT PASS. Seven earlier real checks passed,
  including baseline native pointer controls,
  actual baseline and private candidate
  body bridge + Rust, full production empty
  margin blocked with no false activation,
  and correctly aligned exterior underlay
  controls before/after baseline teardown
  and after private LEFT candidate remap.
  Eighth test `candidate_empty_margin_pass_through`
  recorded exactly one real underlay click,
  no accidental body activation, but
  `target_alignment=off_target`.
  The runner correctly marked
  `candidate_margin_target_unverified`.
  Owned nested compositor/layers/Rust cleanup
  and host output invariance passed. This
  is not evidence that the LEFT candidate
  mask is faulty or that it passes.
  The separate latest dynamic TOP, BOTTOM
  and RIGHT private one-output, size=1
  A/B trials remain real PASS within
  their limited scopes. Previous TOP
  off-target pointer drift remains
  a separate unresolved observation.
- New input-FREE retrospective path now
  staged, not yet run:
  `scripts/aqua-private-left-margin-diagnostic.py`
  commit `5b09ca99107ea1c7107c3d32d3e1e40eabc1077e`,
  `scripts/aqua-private-left-margin-publish.py`
  commit `008cd132c79dd657b361e76b8a8ef64aea5bac02`,
  plus dedicated inert negative contracts
  `scripts/test-aqua-private-left-margin-diagnostic.py`
  (latest fix `f4024d971c7971b38472f3fd93cd6e4ab16ccdf2`)
  and
  `scripts/test-aqua-private-left-margin-publish-contract.py`
  commit `cfb24dc8fc9f58fe9dc1ccbbd0ebf7b8e1b2c68e`.
  EXACT report/blob, original child/target
  source SHA and same-user prior private log
  are all allowlisted. The old report's
  first 7 qualified controls imply exactly
  FIVE real underlay clicks: disabled
  body center, enabled exterior,
  after-unmap exterior, candidate exterior,
  candidate last empty margin. The
  three exterior controls target the
  same position and must be consistent
  within 12 px of one another.
  The old disabled-center matched
  underlay witness shares exactly
  the LEFT margin's REQUESTED x;
  its requested y is
  47 px above disabled center within
  at most 1 px round-to-even ambiguity.
  Using only these relative geometry
  anchors, the helper emits coarse
  direction/magnitude buckets, flags
  whether the last click landed near
  the previous disabled-center
  or candidate exterior positions,
  and NEVER exports raw x/y, log,
  exact private paths, sockets or
  host identifying data. The
  publisher can non-force push only
  its own single categorical result
  `docs/aqua-pointer-left-margin-drift-20261001T175020Z-5a11aa42-5b72e0e3294c.json`
  from a clean permission-private
  throwaway `dev` clone, leaving
  the owner's original possibly
  divergent checkout untouched.
  The full technical design and
  source-derived caveats are in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  updated `4933959a2f374f9d72d9ffa11efc79dd1ca5cb6a`.
- **NEXT LOCAL ACTION:** on user's host,
  one permission-private fresh `dev`
  clone; run BOTH new inert contracts;
  then explicitly run only
  `python3 scripts/aqua-private-left-margin-publish.py
  --publish-existing-left-margin-off-target`.
  This reads the previous private log,
  publishes a safely categorical result
  and **does not execute Niri/Rust/wdotool**.
  If private log is missing or any
  witness/source is ambiguous, stop
  INCONCLUSIVE, DO NOT launch a new
  blind physical pointer test, expand
  source scope or lower any position
  tolerance. Review the unique
  sanitized report first to decide
  whether the next physical trial
  needs additional phase-local input
  instrumentation. Production Region,
  default-off and `stable` remain
  unchanged. Precise curved visual
  input Region, hover/popup, multioutput,
  fractional scaling, hotplug, suspend,
  long-run reliability, aesthetic
  acceptance and canonical-wide
  validation remain separate after
  four-edge private pointer qualification.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 existing left drift verified; left pre-body differential source staged

- The previously staged no-input retrospective LEFT
  analysis has now actually completed and published
  `docs/aqua-pointer-left-margin-drift-20261001T175020Z-5a11aa42-5b72e0e3294c.json`.
  The exact original left test source
  `5b72e0e3294c32276c306b3c6911fd9fa4e79fb1`
  remains **INCONCLUSIVE** only at its last
  candidate empty-margin click; the first
  seven real pointer controls and cleanup
  passed. The five-witness exact-session
  classifier independently found the
  final actual underlay click displaced
  96+ pixels in at least one relative
  axis, BOTH axes changed, horizontal
  positive/vertical negative, near
  neither its former disabled-body-center
  nor candidate exterior actual point.
  This is prior real input log evidence,
  NOT proof of any virtual backend,
  compositor or candidate input-mask
  root cause. New TOP, BOTTOM and RIGHT
  dynamic private single-output scale=1
  separate real PASS reports remain
  source-pinned. The old off-target TOP
  trial remains a distinct unresolved
  flakiness observation.
- New source-only guarded physical
  differential on **LEFT ONLY**:
  child `3e9f843906edf1654ef3b150bad9de2413e61826`
  adds an independent
  `candidate_left_margin_before_body_control`
  on the SAME left empty-host-margin target
  immediately after a matched candidate
  exterior click and BEFORE the real
  candidate-body bridge/Rust click.
  It requires exact matched underlay
  alignment at the unchanged 6px
  tolerance and zero accidental
  bridge/Rust response; else stops
  FAILED on matched+false activation
  or INCONCLUSIVE on absent/ambiguous/
  off-target coordinates. If it PASSes,
  the runner still performs the original
  adjacent real body click then the
  original final margin target, without
  interposed actions. This can bound
  whether the second margin misses
  only after a Aqua body event, but
  does NOT identify causality.
  Parent `9c36779c39d08cdc95c9882fe79973c02b8622e6`
  exact-source pins the new child blob
  `8dd65a0d10d5a8d1475be0939dbb78a0f977dd35`
  and increases audited coordinator
  history from 14 to 15 revisions.
  Separate inert pointer tests updated
  `c1f274ecc8fe44ec663cdd7a3984dbc81db4ef85`
  for pure differential decision and
  `ddf0f55afbd28ea3dab93986ab3a27952a11c5c5`
  for candidate source pin and left-only
  witness. Documentation in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  checkpoint
  `38798daceb1df9e58be614aa947fefe5f72a8d8c`.
  Existing production Region/default-off,
  native Rust and top/bottom/right
  original pointer test semantics
  unchanged. No LEFT differential
  local real result exists yet.
- **NEXT SINGLE LOCAL GATE:** fresh
  clean permission-private temporary
  `dev` clone, NEVER reset/rebase/merge
  the maintainer's original potentially
  divergent local branch. Run all FOUR
  existing inert Aqua pointer contracts,
  then ONE explicit
  `python3 scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py
  --acknowledge-nested-pointer-candidate-left`
  on a verified newly owned nested
  one-output Niri using native absolute
  backend, real private Rust and the
  added pre-body same-target witness.
  Require unique exact-source sanitized
  `docs/aqua-mask-left-*.json` report;
  inspect pre-body candidate margin
  result and direct body→final-margin
  result independently. If either
  misses coordinates, STOP
  INCONCLUSIVE and analyze phase
  without blind retry. Do not
  mutate `stable`, production
  QML or host configuration.
  Four-edge private pointer gating
  does NOT qualify curved exact
  silhouette, hover/popup/visual
  fit, multioutput/fractional-scale,
  hotplug/reload/suspend/lifecycle,
  reliability or canonical-wide
  validation.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 four-edge BBOX live PASS; inert curve feasibility next

- New exact-source REAL LEFT differential
  `docs/aqua-mask-left-20261001T180740Z-22d0c52b-df1cb0eef52e.json`,
  `source_sha=df1cb0eef52e4089833704c32510d65239c5ae41`,
  is **PASS** on one verified newly owned
  Niri output, private source-shadow BBOX,
  scale=1. The new independent margin
  witness BEFORE the candidate-body event,
  genuine body bridge + private Rust,
  and unchanged final adjacent
  candidate-body→margin witness ALL
  passed, with exact underlay alignment
  and zero accidental body activation.
  Production A/B controls,
  post-baseline-unmap witness,
  new candidate exterior,
  host output invariants and full
  owned cleanup passed separately.
  Latest four unique physical private
  dynamic BBOX A/B receipts are now
  TOP `docs/aqua-mask-candidate-20261001T173129Z-ce33db3c-8efa0b7d7341.json`,
  BOTTOM `docs/aqua-mask-bottom-20261001T173542Z-10d599c4-9ac701f650dc.json`,
  RIGHT `docs/aqua-mask-right-20261001T174248Z-cd6a3010-cdbe02bbcd61.json`,
  LEFT new report above; all FOUR are
  real individual bounded PASSes.
  Earlier separate TOP/LEFT real
  off-target runs and their
  retrospective categorical drift
  reports REMAIN unresolved
  reliability observations. No
  production Aqua input Region,
  Rust native backend, defaults,
  host setup or `stable` has
  been changed.
- New source-only visual-shape
  feasibility research:
  `scripts/aqua-silhouette-band-prototype.py`
  commit `d9d5ab6d4b80fb1fbf22292c693a66e5464bded3`
  plus strict inert
  `scripts/test-aqua-silhouette-band-prototype.py`
  latest fix
  `d7465907230d047c0ff647da6b884000f121856a`.
  Pins the exact current
  `WaterDropletBody.qml` four-cubic
  source blob, models the static
  76x92 path interior with
  400 samples per cubic and
  1.7px conservative
  side inset at three samples
  per 1px row, coalesces
  identical spans and maps
  rectangles through source-measured
  four-edge rotations/host offsets.
  The independent prototype-formula
  estimate is ~43 rectangles,
  ~3006 interior px versus
  6992 px body BBOX (~43%),
  showing a STATIC tight
  alpha-like hit approximation
  may exclude too much visible
  tip/stroke/halo/animated body.
  This estimate is NOT
  live QML/Quickshell performance,
  visual-ergonomic acceptance,
  production release approval
  or a maintainer-host run
  of the new Python contract.
  No script generates a live
  mask or injects pointer input.
  Official Quickshell `Region`
  documents nested Rect/Ellipse
  compositing but has no
  verified arbitrary Qt
  `PathCubic` alpha hit mask.
  Design analysis and every
  evidence boundary in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  (latest checkpoint commit
  `26dd1c1b2ff71083f250637aa77b9739281ce464`).
- **NEXT SOURCE / LOCAL GATE:** run
  ONLY the new static silhouette
  inert contract on a clean
  throwaway current `dev`
  clone to check real
  Python/Qt-source agreement;
  do NOT instantiate a
  43-Region live mask
  or replace the currently
  source-shadow tested
  BBOX automatically.
  Next resolve accessible
  interactive footprint,
  animated bob/sway/stretch/
  tilt/squash + pulse halo
  envelope and rotation/scale
  transform obligations,
  Quickshell version/API
  compatibility and nested
  pointer+hover witnesses
  BEFORE any source-guarded
  private visual mask trial.
  Independently test
  repeatability of the
  observed rare off-target
  virtual-pointer transients.
  Actual curved-shape/halo
  quality, hover/popup,
  multioutput/fractional
  scaling, hotplug,
  suspend/reload/lifecycle,
  long-run resources
  and canonical-wide
  validation remain
  unqualified.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 static curve and motion footprint: separate inert source risk gates

- Latest four-edge independently published
  PRIVATE, scale=1, single-output Niri dynamic
  BBOX trials all remain real PASS; they
  do not qualify the final production
  hit shape, animated geometry, hover or
  rare pointer reliability. The earlier
  distinct TOP/LEFT off-target old
  runs and retrospective classification
  reports remain unresolved, and no
  new runtime or host-local geometry
  test receipt is available for this
  checkpoint.
- New strictly inert animation/scale
  feasibility tool
  `scripts/aqua-motion-footprint-feasibility.py`
  first source commit
  `cf700d32453b20742b4a32882a1b7516d22d0a32`,
  corrected original body
  implicit-dimensions pin
  `6a9aeeb9d4738e3fc11ebfaaf5c6a603bb45b3c7`,
  deterministic nominal bob
  float normalization
  `c6968fc7963839ee33f59c0c89d59c07aec44bfa`.
  Its independent INERT
  source/trust/negative contract is
  `scripts/test-aqua-motion-footprint-feasibility.py`
  commit
  `8786afdbbebb037812f37d8dd27e4fad734321ca`.
  The tool SHA-pins ALL four original
  production body, bridge, wrapper
  and host-QML source blobs; no
  Niri, Quickshell, Rust, native pointer,
  live input Region or host config
  is touched. It derives ONLY the
  nominal input-clamped source-formula
  values, not actual frame extrema
  through Qt SpringAnimation/OutBack,
  actual mask mapping, observed Rust
  state frequency, or rendered pixels.
- Significant SOURCE-LEVEL
  counterexample to static 76x92
  mask promotion: the bridge permits
  target `squash=0,stretch=1`,
  explicit body bottom-origin
  `yScale=1.06`, and the upper
  Bézier point at item y=2
  would map to item y=-3.4
  when other transforms
  are analytically held at
  identity. With actual source
  TOP body host offset y=3,
  tip would nominally reach
  host y=-0.4, outside both
  original test-candidate
  static body bbox top y=3
  and host y=0. This is an
  admissible isolated
  source-state risk, NOT an
  actually witnessed rendered
  Qt/Rust pose. Simple
  source-size arithmetic
  also gives top static
  body 114x138 at parent
  scale1.5 vs host112x98,
  and rotated side body
  138x114 vs host98x112;
  exact Qt parent scale
  pivot, compositor mapping,
  clipping and region refresh
  remain unverified.
  Bridge-clamped nominal
  `state_xScale` .925–1.075
  and `state_yScale`
  .905–1.095, root tap
  squash scale targets
  .98775–1.035, and
  state/sway expression
  nominal angles -9.6–
  +10.59 degrees MUST NOT
  be mistaken for guaranteed
  live SpringAnimation
  extrema. The pulse halo
  at full intensity has
  nominal 76x90.16
  local extent; treating
  any bright halo/ripple
  as a click target is
  a separate UX decision.
- This is why even the
  existing source-pinned
  four-cubic static
  approximately 43-band,
  43%-BBOX conservative
  outline study cannot
  be promoted to a moving
  exact hit shape, or
  used to claim actual
  Quickshell runtime
  performance. Current
  real full-host mask,
  Aqua default-off,
  native backend and
  `stable` remain unchanged.
  Expanded technical
  design with precise
  source-bounded vs
  unqualified runtime
  observations in
  `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`
  checkpoint commit
  `c755f46276aae77aa01922d57a3b42b6f37639ea`.
- **NEXT SINGLE LOCAL ACTION:**
  run BOTH standalone
  inert geometric test
  scripts on a fresh
  clean private `dev`
  clone:
  `python3 scripts/test-aqua-silhouette-band-prototype.py`
  and
  `python3 scripts/test-aqua-motion-footprint-feasibility.py`;
  print BOTH inert redacted
  model summaries, record
  PASS/FAIL locally.
  No host pointer input
  or production changes.
  Then design an explicit
  PRIVATE motion-aware
  body-interaction
  hypothesis with generous
  touch target for all
  pose/tip boundaries,
  possible decorative
  halo distinction,
  exact source-pinned
  Quickshell runtime
  version and real
  `mapToItem`/Region
  live geometry probes.
  Qualify each edge,
  sizes 0.65/1/1.5,
  motion extrema, hover,
  popup, multimonitor
  fractional/hotplug,
  lifecycle/resource
  and canonical-wide
  behavior separately.
  Do not implement
  a production mask
  based on the 43-band
  feasibility or
  nominal transform
  arithmetic alone.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 private inert geometry/motion receipt staged; await real local execution

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 actual-QML 24-pose first local gate blocked by stale inert assertion

- The maintainer's fresh private `dev` clone at exact source `aa59e2f09c211219fef7a8153fa27abe94efd63b` stopped during `scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-motion-geometry-contract.py`: `AssertionError: body.stateStretch = 1`. The guard searched for an obsolete literal even though the already source-pinned QML fixture assigns the stretch target to all actual repeated hosts via `root.bodyOf(hosts.itemAt(i)).stateStretch = 1`. This is a diagnosed inert test assertion mismatch. The actual 24-pose offscreen Quickshell runner was NOT executed; no `docs/aqua-qt-motion-*.json` result was published. Do not count any Qt geometry pose as observed.
- A test-only forward fix at commit `d38699b4385d5aeb2a284d65bdaecb5de1823c5f` replaces the obsolete assertion with the precise existing per-host stretch assignment, and additionally checks the neutral `body.stateStretch=0` initialization and fixture's `expectedStretch`/actual frozen-state witness predicate. New inert test blob `73572134c29ccbc448bb0d48290ae7b0e99637c5`. The production QML, offscreen fixture blob `11df91496a8bb9b18d79498e86d1f734d78dc574`, runner blob `0dd833ed05d54e9d1045553a1da8be8f66b6511a`, backend, existing full-host input mask, default-off configuration and `stable` are unchanged. Remote static source comparison found all 13 referenced QML conditions present, but the repaired Python inert contract has NOT yet earned local runtime PASS.
- NEXT: ONE fresh permission-private, clean `dev` clone; recheck its HEAD and run the repaired inert contract. Only if it passes, run the existing acknowledged bounded offscreen runner and inspect one unique new `docs/aqua-qt-motion-*.json` source-pinned 24-pose report on GitHub. Do not reuse the failed prior clone, hand-edit the reviewed fixture, relax SHA guards, or treat frozen poses as a live SpringAnimation/Wayland/hover/production mask qualification.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 actual frozen QML 24/24 PASS; independently guarded sampled dynamic gate STAGED

- The local repaired inert contract was followed by the reviewed real Qt offscreen runner; UNIQUE exact-source published receipt `docs/aqua-qt-motion-20261001T185752Z-53e5c5cc-72ac0580b12e.json` on `source_sha=72ac0580b12e08c88e74f69ac919e30a93f481f4` reports actual 24/24 PASS at Quickshell 0.3.1. Every one of four edges × three scales × neutral/stretched verified frozen state was observed and parent-scale Qt geometry was consistent. All neutral body boxes remain inside their source static body box and host. On ALL THREE scales, actual frozen stretch=1 makes transformed body ITEM AABB leave the former static body box on all four edges; transformed item AABB leaves host on TOP and BOTTOM; upper path TIP leaves host on TOP. The body item AABB is NOT pixel-exact outline/clipping or an observed input-mask shape.
- A separate report `docs/aqua-qt-motion-20261001T190302Z-a0fcad4b-5f5331d7fb6d.json` on `source_sha=5f5331d7fb6d1b689f245e630e0eebfe56fb8b4d` independently repeats SAME frozen categories, 24/24 PASS and QS 0.3.1; source comparison from first to second showed docs, prior report and private dynamic fixture only, no production Aqua runtime change. These are two frozen-pose experiments, NOT real animation/hover reliability.
- New SOURCE-ONLY private sampled-motion gate is staged on `dev`: 12 distinct existing original-QML hosts (4 edges, 3 scales), both controlled stretch/release phases, measured Qt 40ms sampled body-box/tip/host geometry; per-host neutral and frozen-stretch guards; live intermediate stretch AND near-target stretch, actual `motionEnabled` and independent bob/sway positive witnesses. Fixture `scripts/aqua-fixtures/motion-envelope/shell.qml` blob `0fede26c2dc370234ae1b1702afdca3ea05e33e0`; private runner `scripts/aqua-manual-offscreen-dynamic-geometry.py` blob `71262816d9d64c97061c90e03bed9acee76bdc18`; independent negative/sanitized inert contract `scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-dynamic-geometry-contract.py` blob `08ca436a007d5d78831655644bee455d77f4cd28`. Runner reuses frozen source/clean-clone guard, pins first frozen receipt and these reviewed blobs, requires local QS version 0.3.1 before testing, enforces 512-KiB private log file size and owned process group cleanup, and may non-force publish only ONE unique sanitized source-SHA-pinned `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json`. Raw coordinates and logs stay private. **The new contract and runner have NOT been executed locally and no dynamic report exists**.
- IMPORTANT: A controlled sampled frame witness is neither a guaranteed complete SpringAnimation envelope nor a real Rust trace; it cannot certify painted contour clipping, Wayland Region, live click/hover, old rare TOP/LEFT pointer drift, popup safety, fractional/multioutput, hotplug, lifecycle/performance or canonical validation. Production full-host mask, backend, disabled-by-default Aqua and `stable` unchanged. Phase 4 and Phase 5 remain open.
- **NEXT SINGLE LOCAL ACTION:** start ONE fresh current-user-owned mode-0700 private clean `dev` clone in `XDG_STATE_HOME/hadalis/aqua-qt-motion.*`. FIRST run `python3 scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-dynamic-geometry-contract.py`, require exact `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS`. Only on that PASS, run `python3 scripts/aqua-manual-offscreen-dynamic-geometry.py --acknowledge-private-offscreen-dynamic-motion` from the same fresh clone. The runner fetches latest `dev` and must stop on changed pins or runtime versions. User then enters `tiếp tục`; FIRST inspect an actually published `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json` on GitHub, its exact SHA and per-edge phase witnesses. If no report/INCONCLUSIVE, investigate only the specific failure; do not automatically rerun or move on to physical pointer experiments.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 dynamic report still absent; private QML runner cleanup hardened

- Fresh GitHub `dev` inspection found NO new `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json` after the prior staged dynamic gate. The maintainer has not supplied the prior local status. Do **not** infer inert success, Qt run failure, or a completed dynamic sample from the absence of a published receipt. Existing two 24/24 frozen-pose QML reports remain historical evidence; they do not certify dynamic frames.
- A source-level review of the staged dynamic runner found a real cleanup assurance gap: termination of the `dbus-run-session` wrapper was not sufficient evidence that all owned child processes exited. Test-only fix `d0df7600baecdd320eab4b4534618ccf454eb8cb` now additionally strips inherited `QML_IMPORT_PATH`/`QML2_IMPORT_PATH`, sends TERM to its own process group, checks whether that private group survives, attempts KILL on remaining owned members and fails closed if cleanup is still unverified. No user desktop or shared shell process should be targeted. This change is SOURCE-ONLY; it has NOT been locally exercised. New runner blob `8270d405809bff86599e570399dd05a390e22601`; separate inert test `c923e664eebb49a56a18fd3b45a418ecfff55730` pins it and checks environment/cleanup guard tokens (blob `9a858ca789c5cb7bd3fac778ff844396b726e969`). Dynamic fixture original blob `0fede26c2dc370234ae1b1702afdca3ea05e33e0` and production Aqua code remain unchanged.
- NEXT: FIRST retrieve/classify any earlier saved LOCAL dynamic inert/runner status WITHOUT rerunning an uncertain test; the owner can send only allowlisted short `GATE`/`STOP`/source lines, never raw private logs. If an old run had no report, investigate exactly that failure before a fresh retry. If no prior dynamic run exists, use ONE new permission-private clean `dev` clone, require current static blobs, run `scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-dynamic-geometry-contract.py` first and only after its token PASS invoke `scripts/aqua-manual-offscreen-dynamic-geometry.py --acknowledge-private-offscreen-dynamic-motion`. Inspect exact published `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json` before extending to compositor/pointer tests. Staged source + static inspection alone is NOT a Qt/contract PASS. Maintain default-off Aqua, original host mask/Rust backend and untouched `stable`.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 dynamic Qt gate: added independent mapped-frame motion witness; local evidence still absent

- Rechecked current remote `dev` after the last manual command: there was NO new `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json` report. The user's prior local terminal result was NOT received; neither a previously attempted FAIL nor an executed dynamic PASS can be inferred. Do not automatically rerun without classifying any retained previous local status. The two published 24/24 frozen-pose Qt PASS reports remain distinct from real sampled motion.
- Source audit found that requiring `bob_witness`, `sway_witness` and animated `stateStretch` numerically is NOT sufficient by itself to prove that the transformed real QML item *moved* in host coordinates (for example, authored anchors can mask a nominal position property). The privately staged dynamic fixture now retains only locally held per-host previous real Qt `mapToItem` body AABB values, resets these private baselines at the start of EACH controlled stretch and release phase, and explicitly requires a >0.12-unit inter-sample mapped AABB difference before setting `mapped_frame_change_witness` for that host and phase. NO actual coordinate values are included in the public fixture marker or prospective redacted receipt. This is evidence of observed body geometry varying within the sampled phase, not proof that each separate bob/sway component independently moves the rendered silhouette.
- Source-only update: `scripts/aqua-fixtures/motion-envelope/shell.qml` exact blob `221c07d0a451ba918e3e2074aeafe389e588f594`; pinned private runner `scripts/aqua-manual-offscreen-dynamic-geometry.py` exact blob `12ade72c22912c44aa3e66a2b5aef62c9e8b58f3`; synthetic negative inert contract `scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-dynamic-geometry-contract.py` exact blob `1598ab0730667254e0a0bcf0f64393ff2d50fbcd`. The runner now marks a host/phase INCONCLUSIVE if that observed mapped change witness is absent; its previously hardened process-group/QML-import isolation, Quickshell 0.3.1 guard, original renderer source pins, log bounds and sanitized one-report push remain in place. The inert contract pins both new exact blobs and includes a false mapped-motion witness negative case.
- Remote source-agreement audit checked both per-phase private baseline resets, positive mapped-frame witness, allowlisted no-coordinate fixture publication, runner strict phase checks and the inert negative/pin statements. This audit is NOT a locally executed Python/Qt PASS. The next local step remains FIRST classify any previous retained `STOP`/`GATE`/source output; only if no prior dynamic attempt exists run the revised inert contract on ONE NEW mode-0700 privately cloned current `dev`, and only if it prints `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS` invoke the explicit acknowledged offscreen dynamic runner. Inspect the exact new `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json` on GitHub before any real pointer/nested compositor experiment. Keep Aqua default off; preserve current production full-host Region, backend and `stable`.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 actual first dynamic run: inert PASS, QML marker inconclusive; diagnose old private log first

- The maintainer returned actual local status for the exact old source `ad79725acda0fe3c61ba6b1afaba700e1a73b78b`: `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS`, then `STOP: private_dynamic_qml_marker_inconclusive`. This proves the old synthetic contract completed, but establishes NO valid Qt dynamic matrix, no witnessed mapped motion and no result receipt. The old runner used a combined stop code for child exit nonzero, fixture `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INVALID`, fixture `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_TIMEOUT`, no geometry marker or duplicate markers. There is NO published `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json` to substitute for this missing local evidence. Do NOT assume an animation bug, true lack of geometry change, or Qt import failure without first reading a **sanitized classification** of the previous run's private `dynamic-qml/dynamic.private.log`. Do not request full/raw logs, coordinates or private paths.
- Source-only forward hardening of the CURRENT dev runner at `c9770356bbbe276828b08171013107eca65e3882` added pure `categorize_private_qml_failure(raw, code, marker_count)`, printing ONLY a fixed non-sensitive failure category before the existing fail-closed stop. Possible categories include FIXTURE_INVALID, FIXTURE_TIMEOUT, QML_IMPORT_FAILURE, QML_SCRIPT_ERROR, QML_COMPONENT_ERROR, QT_PLATFORM_FAILURE, PRIVATE_QS_NONZERO_EXIT and MISSING/DUPLICATE_GEOMETRY_MARKER. Its exact current blob `c152a1fec7a5a1514407d7850549f987923621c2` still source-pins the reviewed private mapped-frame fixture blob `221c07d0a451ba918e3e2074aeafe389e588f594`; unchanged runtime source and private process-group guards. New exact negative inert contract blob `86a684f9a0712b06f160d00adead2cd3faff3291` pins this diagnostic runner and adds synthetic categorical/privacy assertions. These new assertions have been source-staged only; NO local success has been observed at the revised source SHA.
- **NEXT SINGLE LOCAL ACTION: OLD LOG CLASSIFICATION ONLY, NO RERUN.** In the original retained private `aqua-qt-motion.*` clone at `ad79725...`, classify the private `dynamic-qml/dynamic.private.log` locally using only predeclared categories, booleans, marker counts, and optionally safe QML basename/line numbers. Never display raw lines, coordinates, paths or environment details. Once classified, investigate the specific old fixture failure or runtime category and fix forward at current `dev` if justified; only then consider a NEW permission-private SHA-pinned rerun. Do not use the stale old clone for reruns. Aqua default-off, original production input Region, Rust backend and `stable` remain untouched.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 old local dynamic log: zero markers, zero fixture sentinel, unclassified process result

- The maintainer performed a read-only sanitized diagnosis of the retained old run at exact source `ad79725acda0fe3c61ba6b1afaba700e1a73b78b`. It reported `GATE=MISSING_MARKER_OR_CHILD_EXIT`, `GEOMETRY_MARKERS=0`, `FIXTURE_INVALID=False`, `FIXTURE_TIMEOUT=False`, `ERROR_CLASSES=NONE` and `QML_LOCATIONS=NONE`. Coupled with the previous old run's **actual** `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS` and `STOP: private_dynamic_qml_marker_inconclusive`, this proves no output marker, no known fixture abort sentinel, no standard error recognized by the OLD narrow classifier, and NO eligible dynamic geometry or published receipt. The old classifier does NOT distinguish successful child exit without a marker from child nonzero/crash or log truncation; no exit status was persisted by the old runner. Do not claim a QML crash, wrong geometry, a missing Qt module, a verified lack of stretch motion or a PASS from these facts.
- Next safe LOCAL step: one READ-ONLY second-pass fingerprint of the SAME ORIGINAL private `dynamic-qml/dynamic.private.log` (never a rerun, no original worktree mutation or raw log release). Check bounded file size (particularly whether it is exactly at the runner's 512 KiB file limit), nonempty line count, whether the log contains only startup/shutdown notices, selected *fixed* broad Qt/Quickshell/D-Bus/error/signal keywords and whether any console line includes the expected AQUA prefix; emit only allowlisted booleans/categories and coarse counts, never raw messages, paths, screen identifiers or coordinates. If no recognized cause, preserve `UNKNOWN_EARLY_EXIT_OR_MISSING_MARKER` and request an explicitly guarded local run with a separate private exit-code receipt and stage-marker-only instrumentation, not an invented diagnosis.
- The latest dev runner contains its future safe categorical failure diagnostic, and the new mapped-motion witness remains source-staged. Neither retrospectively provides the prior child's exit code. Production full-host mask, source Aqua renderers, default-off behavior, backend and `stable` stay untouched; do not progress to physical pointer tests.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 old dynamic private log fingerprint + staged boot/phase diagnostics

- Maintainer's second READ-ONLY fingerprint of retained failed private real-QML run at \`ad79725acda0fe3c61ba6b1afaba700e1a73b78b\`: \`LOG_BYTES=312\`, \`LOG_LINES=3\`, \`LOG_AT_LIMIT=False\`, \`LOG_ENDS_NEWLINE=True\`, \`GENERIC_ERROR_LINES=0\`, \`WARNING_LINES=0\`, \`FATAL_OR_SIGNAL_LINES=0\`, \`QML_RUNTIME_LINES=0\`, \`QUICKSHELL_LINES=1\`, \`DBUS_LINES=0\`, \`PLATFORM_LINES=0\`, \`LIBRARY_LINES=0\`, \`FILE_LIMIT_LINES=0\`, \`AQUA_PREFIX_LINES=0\`, \`MAX_REPEATED_LINE=1\`, \`OLD_CHILD_EXIT_CODE=NOT_RECORDED\`, \`GATE=OLD_LOG_FINGERPRINT_COMPLETE\`. Original inert safety test PASS; original actual-QML dynamic run STOP \`private_dynamic_qml_marker_inconclusive\`. This establishes a tiny, complete, unqualified log, not a file-size cutoff, but still DOES NOT identify a premature successful shell exit, loader/CLI behavior, unlogged crash, or cause in source. The original runner discarded the child's return code, so it cannot be reconstructed from the existing 3 lines without unsupported guesses.
- Source-only instrumentation has now been added to PRIVATE offscreen dynamic fixture, **not** production: QML logs ONLY ordered literal markers \`BOOT\`, \`SETUP_START\`, \`FROZEN_VERIFIED\`, \`NEUTRAL_VERIFIED\`, \`STRETCH_SAMPLE\`, \`RELEASE_START\`, \`RELEASE_SAMPLE\`, \`SAMPLING_DONE\`. Stage markers never serialize motion values, host coordinates or screen metadata. Instrumented fixture exact Git blob: \`6e3b5402d32d263868c1ec688925adba0fd7250b\` (staging commit \`62e5418b8ad6d86858a2913c0b5156e0ba7ad154\`). Runner now preserves the privacy of the raw log but emits \`PRIVATE_QS_EXIT_CLASS\` (\`ZERO/NONZERO/SIGNAL\`), \`PRIVATE_QML_STAGES\` count, \`PRIVATE_QML_LAST_STAGE\` allowlisted category, and its existing fixed failure classification. If a geometry marker is present but stage order/census is not exactly complete, stop fail-closed instead of publishing a PASS. Runner exact blob \`9978fa6da0fd2e05b7d52a801fc9cce4a4e5131d\` (commit \`28f07ebbbe2d2a1dcb4d117b03d0160781ad6e83\`); fixture and frozen/production pins unchanged apart from explicit expected fixture revision. Negative inert test exact blob \`4ca0fb183131b67a67920ba60530f85e1631f2be\` (commit \`09feece3079e78cd12ffac49c77864767f7c34ea\`) source-pins the changes and tests synthetic complete, absent, duplicate and unexpected stage markers plus child return classes. No dynamic private runtime PASS or NEW local Python inert PASS has been observed for this staging revision.
- **NEXT SINGLE LOCAL GATE (explicit user action only)**: ONE NEW owned permission-0700 clean remote \`dev\` clone in a new private state folder, not the old failed clone. First pin and run the current \`scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-dynamic-geometry-contract.py\` and require its exact \`AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS\`. Only then run the explicit \`scripts/aqua-manual-offscreen-dynamic-geometry.py --acknowledge-private-offscreen-dynamic-motion\`. Report ONLY its controlled \`PRIVATE_QS_EXIT_CLASS\`, \`PRIVATE_QML_STAGES\`, \`PRIVATE_QML_LAST_STAGE\`, \`PRIVATE_QML_FAILURE_CATEGORY\`, STOP and sanitized unique report marker. If the runner produces a receipt, validate full report source SHA and observed frame witnesses before attempting a Niri input test. If no BOOT stage, compare isolated launch with a separately approved frozen known-good startup control; never infer real animation regression without a loaded and observed fixture.
- Keep production full-host Region, disabled-by-default Aqua, original QML/Rust backend and \`stable\` unchanged. Source-only safe instrumentation is NOT a locally verified PASS.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 second actual dynamic run: child nonzero before BOOT; bounded private log fingerprint staged

- Maintainer ran the SHA-pinned dynamic private Qt gate again in a NEW private clean `dev` clone (source `c1ab9cdbbb5a23f8dd83c0b8926f2110ad6d1948`). Local stdout: `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS`; `PRIVATE_QS_EXIT_CLASS=NONZERO`; `PRIVATE_QML_STAGES=0`; `PRIVATE_QML_LAST_STAGE=NO_BOOT`; `PRIVATE_QML_FAILURE_CATEGORY=PRIVATE_QS_NONZERO_EXIT`; `STOP: private_dynamic_qml_marker_inconclusive`. Original runner returned no dynamic receipt and no compositor/pointer/production edit was attempted. This is direct **Qt process startup/fixture load** blockage, NOT evidence about actual QML animation geometry or input. The new result does not explain the origin of the child's nonzero exit; neither a specific Qt import problem nor QML parse bug is verified.
- Earlier first attempt's 312-byte / 3-line log at `ad79725...` is from an OLD different execution. Do NOT present its size or line counts as evidence for the newer `c1ab9cd...` log. The new retained private scratch contains its own `dynamic-qml/dynamic.private.log`; never expose raw contents, local path, screen coordinates or environment details.
- Compared the current dynamic runner startup against the earlier real-Qt frozen fixture runner: both launch the fixture through a private offscreen `dbus-run-session -- qs --path <isolated shell.qml>`, with the same on-clone reviewed symlink dependencies. The dynamic gate additionally drops inherited QML import paths, hard-limits log size, and adds explicit stage markers. Prior frozen 24/24 successes are **historical** and do not alone establish whether the CURRENT local Quickshell environment or new fixture can still boot.
- Added a strictly READ-ONLY bounded input/fixed-schema local log classification helper `scripts/aqua-private-offscreen-boot-fingerprint.py` (source blob `2c7a4e069492c1a72d321f91fa509d9d94736002`, commit `17473b48fff8563a4a835cf06b9722e0c7eefa7e`), with synthetic privacy/negative contract `scripts/test-aqua-private-offscreen-boot-fingerprint.py` (blob `a9b5116454540ca4a95c085e93509bd2312704b7`, commit `2a10344ccc8ef2746e567df3a66e2d1d493db881`). The helper verifies the exact original clone source/owned scratch/safe origin, reads ONLY its bounded retained log, emits predeclared category + safe-vocabulary + length-band classifications per line and counts, and NEVER prints the private original log lines or starts Qt. The test is SOURCE-STAGED but NOT YET RUN locally. This helper does NOT reconstruct an exit code or claim a root cause.
- **NEXT**: run the inert helper contract in a separate fresh read-only tool clone and classify the *newer retained* original `c1ab9cd...` log, requiring output `AQUA_PRIVATE_BOOT_FINGERPRINT_INERT_PASS` before accepting its classifier. If exact logged clues are still unclassified, design an explicitly acknowledged isolated **minimal ShellRoot vs previously successful frozen QML control** probe under the same current private offscreen env to separate local Quickshell CLI/Qt startup changes from dynamic fixture load. Do NOT rerun a full dynamic sweep or touch production based on inference; Phase 4/5 remain open, Aqua default off, full-host Region retained and `stable` untouched.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 repeated pre-BOOT dynamic Qt failure, controlled startup A/B/C isolated

- The owner's *newer* permission-private local attempt (source `c1ab9cdbbb5a23f8dd83c0b8926f2110ad6d1948`) achieved `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS` but the actual Quickshell child returned `PRIVATE_QS_EXIT_CLASS=NONZERO`, `PRIVATE_QML_STAGES=0`, `PRIVATE_QML_LAST_STAGE=NO_BOOT`, `PRIVATE_QML_FAILURE_CATEGORY=PRIVATE_QS_NONZERO_EXIT`, then fail-closed STOP. The exact log from that same clone was independently fingerprinted after an inert PASS: 312 bytes, 3 lines, no Aqua marker; line 1 had safe terms CONFIG and QML but matched none of the existing failure categories, line 2 matched none, line 3 contained QUICKSHELL. A generic config/QML startup clue is not enough to assert an import error, argument error, source syntax error or cause. No actual dynamic observations; do not conflate this with the successful *historical* frozen 24/24 reports.
- Compared reviewed frozen and current dynamic launch implementation. Both use a private temporary `shell.qml`, reviewed source symlinks, private XDG directories, `dbus-run-session -- qs --path`, offscreen platform and cleared compositor socket environment. The dynamic runner additionally removes inherited `QML_IMPORT_PATH` and `QML2_IMPORT_PATH`, sets a log file size limit and expects staged QML markers. The historically successful frozen runner has NOT been rerun on the current local environment, so it cannot rule out common current startup or isolated path failure.
- Staged a **separate**, explicit-opt-in, bounded, NON-PUBLISHING private actual-Qt startup control runner `scripts/aqua-private-offscreen-boot-controls.py` (Git blob `7c0a29bcaac7d576615ce20bd1b15b021cb951c0`, commit `53700c631144fbc1b788f0e344a5b4ecd951495b`): three independent 0700 private `dbus-run-session` offscreen launch environments. `MINIMAL_DYNAMIC_ENV`: synthetic minimal ShellRoot with dynamic-like import-path sanitization. `FROZEN_DYNAMIC_ENV`: EXACT source-pinned formerly passing frozen Aqua fixture with dynamic-like import-path sanitization. `FROZEN_HISTORICAL_ENV`: SAME frozen fixture under historical import-path inheritance. Each uses separate `XDG_*`, hard file-size limit, short timeout, owned private process-group cleanup, source + frozen fixture checks and the recorded Quickshell 0.3.1 guard. stdout contains only fixed per-control PASS/INCONCLUSIVE, ZERO/NONZERO/SIGNAL/TIMEOUT, ONE/NONE/MULTIPLE marker, fixed fixture-abort and Quickshell-presence booleans. It stores any original control logs ONLY locally and never publishes a report, runs pointer input, touches existing production UI or calls the dynamic production mask. Distinct read-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-offscreen-boot-controls.py` (blob `3731898020bd9a844ea8238bdbbc36b192ec9dc5`, commit `605cc2b6a923805227a3788925aa6930045afa7a`) source-pins and synthetically tests marker/abort classifiers and launch safety. Both new sources are STAGED, not executed/verified locally.
- **NEXT SINGLE USER LOCAL COMMAND**: NEW mode-0700 permission-private clean `dev` scratch clone; assert the two exact Git blobs above; run `scripts/test-aqua-private-offscreen-boot-controls.py` and require `AQUA_BOOT_CONTROLS_INERT_PASS`; only on PASS, invoke `scripts/aqua-private-offscreen-boot-controls.py --acknowledge-private-boot-controls`. Report only printed categorical result lines. Branch-dependent interpretation: MINIMAL FAIL suggests general isolated Quickshell runtime/bootstrap; MINIMAL PASS/FROZEN_DYNAMIC FAIL suggests original Aqua/dependency loading; FROZEN_DYNAMIC PASS plus the prior dynamic NO_BOOT points toward dynamic fixture-specific bootstrap and will warrant a source-level QML syntax/import audit; FROZEN_HISTORICAL PASS but FROZEN_DYNAMIC FAIL suggests inherited QML import environment matters. These are provisional discriminators, NOT root-cause proof. Neither this isolated control nor prior frozen proof qualifies dynamic geometry or production Region. Keep Aqua default off, original full-host mask and `stable` unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 three private offscreen startup controls uniformly pre-BOOT inconclusive

- The maintainer ran source-pinned startup controls on EXACT `7c9e01dcd3db964a837b12755b088dd2594c9b6d`, after `AQUA_BOOT_CONTROLS_INERT_PASS`. All three PRIVATE nonpublishing controls: `MINIMAL_DYNAMIC_ENV`, `FROZEN_DYNAMIC_ENV`, and `FROZEN_HISTORICAL_ENV`, returned `INCONCLUSIVE`, `EXIT=NONZERO`, `MARKER=NONE`, `FIXTURE_ABORT=NO`, `QS_MENTION=YES`, `CONTROL_VERDICT=STARTUP_ISOLATION_INCONCLUSIVE`. The minimal ShellRoot case contains NO Aqua dependency. Therefore the blocked observation point is SHARED private Quickshell startup or fixture/config selection and cannot be asserted to be a Aqua dynamic animation regression. Do NOT interpret older frozen 24/24 PASS as proof that the *current* local runtime or isolated environment still loads.
- The separate *previous* actual dynamic failure at `c1ab9cdbbb5a23f8dd83c0b8926f2110ad6d1948` was also pre-BOOT with NONZERO child; its fingerprint was 312 bytes and three lines with one safe CONFIG/QML mention and one QUICKSHELL mention. Those are measurements of that old log, NOT of the new three startup controls. The three new private control logs are retained ONLY locally at the maintainer-owned previously reported scratch, each under `boot-controls/<test-lowercase>/control.private.log`. No full raw log, filesystem path, text, coordinates, or environment values should be shared.
- The official Quickshell 0.3.1 CLI documentation supports `--path` with a QML-file path; this rules out an unsupported CLI *syntax assumption*, but not a current launcher/runtime/config path failure, nor user-local sandbox/policy failure. Next action is ONE READ-ONLY local comparison of the three retained private control logs, using the already source-pinned allowlisted `scripts/aqua-private-offscreen-boot-fingerprint.py` classifier (`2c7a4e069492c1a72d321f91fa509d9d94736002`) and NEVER launching Qt. Print only fixed categorical per-line signatures, bounded counts and whether the raw files are internally identical (boolean, not hashes); optionally compare signatures to the previously inspected separate dynamic log without conflating clone/source timestamps. If all signatures are the same and generic, treat cause as UNKNOWN_SHARED_PRIVATE_QS_BOOT; then plan a minimal launcher/config-path-specific private control rather than another full Aqua dynamic sweep. If one log differs, investigate its categorical diagnostic first.
- Current previously reviewed nonpublishing three-control probe `scripts/aqua-private-offscreen-boot-controls.py` blob `7c0a29bcaac7d576615ce20bd1b15b021cb951c0` remains unchanged and still requires explicit private owner invocation. Phase 4 actual dynamic QML gate NOT qualified, no `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json`, real pointer/Niri multioutput and production mask acceptance NOT qualified. Maintain production full-host Region/default-off Aqua and untouched `stable`.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 uniform bootstrap fingerprints; private Qslog postmortem staged

- Maintainer's READ-ONLY classification of exact three retained CONTROL logs from earlier source `7c9e01dcd3db964a837b12755b088dd2594c9b6d` found each had exactly THREE log lines and the IDENTICAL FIXED CLASS/SAFE-TERM/LENGTH signatures: line 1 UNCLASSIFIED + CONFIG/QML + MEDIUM; line 2 UNCLASSIFIED + NONE + MEDIUM; line 3 QUICKSHELL_MESSAGE + QUICKSHELL + MEDIUM. Raw logs are NOT identical; their byte sizes were 335/334/337. Because ALL three actual Qt startup controls also exited NONZERO before any fixture marker, the common failure remains BEFORE any meaningful Aqua dynamics. The matching three-line signatures are compatible with Quickshell's well-documented standard startup banners (launching config; shell/path ID; saving internal logs), **but cannot prove these are the actual messages** because content intentionally remains private.
- External verification against Quickshell upstream 0.3.x CLI and public startup examples: `qs --path` accepts an exact QML file path; `qs log` reads a specified dead instance's binary `log.qslog` without launching a new shell. The observed text-only captured console logs might therefore contain just standard startup banners while a fuller diagnostic was stored in a separate Quickshell internal instance log. This is an UNCONFIRMED hypothesis until exact banner templates and the log path are verified locally from the preserved control log; never scan global user sessions or use `qs list`/unqualified `qs log` to retrieve another instance.
- Added source-only PRIVATE READ-ONLY `scripts/aqua-private-qslog-postmortem.py` Git blob `edd1b35e4a20706daf8d72ee8d8d0ffec7943e08`: accepts ONLY the original owner-owned permission-private `aqua-qt-motion.*` scratch with exact old SHA and pinned original classifier, validates exact three known startup banner templates, enforces expected per-control original `shell.qml` path match and a specific `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/quickshell/by-id/<id>/log.qslog` path (no arbitrary paths), verifies log ownership/size/symlink constraints and optionally invokes ONLY `qs log` for that explicit file IF local CLI help recognizes safe file-read syntax. All decoder output is reclassified through the existing fixed-vocabulary privacy helper; original log text, private paths and identifiers are NEVER printed. It never launches a configuration, follows a log or changes any repo/desktop source. If internal QS log is missing, no assumption about the original startup failure; report unavailable rather than falling back to global instance logs.
- Separate inert synthetic source-pin/negative-privacy test `scripts/test-aqua-private-qslog-postmortem.py` exact blob `528816fcb986f101117857833fccaa3e84d79e52` covers standard/wrong-root/unexpected-banner/unsafe-path formats, symlink rejection, bounded text and no-Qs-launch source contract. Both new files were staged directly on `dev` but have **NOT** been run locally; a reviewed source pin is NOT an inert PASS. Continue single owner action: NEW read-only ephemeral `dev` clone to require exact two file blobs, run the synthetic inert test FIRST; only on PASS invoke the script against the previously retained OLD source `7c9e01dcd3db964a837b12755b088dd2594c9b6d` original scratch. Publish only allowlisted terminal output. If all three banners verified and own internal logs decode, investigate the categorical actual error; if not, mark INCONCLUSIVE and design a separate tightly bounded startup-focused probe rather than rerun the full dynamic Aqua test. Production mask, original backend, default-off Aqua and `stable` remain unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 all three internal Qslogs only repeat startup banners; isolate common Qt boot

- Maintainer ran `scripts/test-aqua-private-qslog-postmortem.py` on a fresh read-only `dev` clone: `AQUA_PRIVATE_QSLOG_POSTMORTEM_INERT_PASS`. Explicit read-only `qs log` postmortem against the exact retained original control clone source `7c9e01dcd3db964a837b12755b088dd2594c9b6d` confirmed all three bootstrap logs ARE precisely Quickshell's recognized normal three-banner pattern (`STANDARD_3_BANNERS`), each unique `log.qslog` existed and decoded, but the decoded content was also exactly three INFO startup banners, with no subsequent error, Aqua marker or QML diagnostic. These are ACTUAL local results; the earlier CLASSIFIER PASS alone does not certify the Qt startups, which had `NONZERO` and `MARKER=NONE` under all three minimal/frozen environments. This closes the unproductive historical-log-recovery path: there is no hidden diagnostic beyond the startup banners in these previously retained QSLOGs.
- User-visible source-only reasoning: because even minimal `import QtQuick; import Quickshell; ShellRoot` did not run a marker, an animation-level regression is not the demonstrated issue. Three cases sharing the same early failure do NOT prove which subsystem failed. Prior frozen 24/24 actual Qt success remains historical and must not be equated with present runtime success.
- Staged a NEW explicit private NON-PUBLISHING synthetic minimal startup probe `scripts/aqua-private-minimal-qs-bootstrap.py` exact blob `edd28683dc1ce679f24aa460e914cfad5abdc0a6` (commit `f8de8cfd85e3226691a0758798a2611b60cf0689`): strictly protected NEW clean dev scratch, same original frozen source audits, Quickshell `0.3.1` / local CLI help guard, only minimal ShellRoot (no Aqua import or Wayland windows), three controlled variants: (`OFFSCREEN_FILE`, `offscreen`, QML file `--path`); (`OFFSCREEN_DIRECTORY`, `offscreen`, enclosing directory `--path`); (`MINIMAL_FILE`, Qt `minimal`, file `--path`). All three run in separate owned private DBus sessions and XDG directories, suppress compositor/desktop socket environment, capture only bounded private stdout/stderr with verbose Quickshell and QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS; a dedicated private Python child classifies the ACTUAL `qs` exit independently of the outer `dbus-run-session` wrapper; stage marker is emitted at QML `Component.onCompleted`, not after a long timer. Public terminal output is only static enum exit/marker/plugin/QML category labels with no private log lines, environment, host coordinates or paths. Owned process-group cleanup is fail-closed. No source or production edit occurs during probe; no GitHub report is published.
- Companion inert synthetic test `scripts/test-aqua-private-minimal-qs-bootstrap.py` exact blob `17122bf3bb22a20b821801ce77276df73a04b4bd` (commit `076bbbe194591141dc756be9fd11f4efe34cd02d`) pins source and validates no-Aqua minimal QML, finite synthetic categories, duplicate/absent marker rejection, actual child exit classification and private launch guard tokens. Both sources are STAGED only, not yet executed/Qt-qualified in maintainer's environment. Distinguishing file path vs directory and Qt platform may reveal configuration resolution or plugin initialization; if all fail before immediate Component.onCompleted even with local Quickshell child categorization, treat as COMMON EARLY QS/Qt environment blocker and investigate exact sanitized plugin categories before a full dynamic test. Do NOT infer a root cause or weaken normal production security.
- NEXT: ONE single private clean `dev` clone, assert both exact source blobs, run inert contract first, then explicitly acknowledged minimal standalone source. Publish only its fixed `OFFSCREEN_*`/`MINIMAL_FILE_*` and `GATE` lines. No dynamic receipts, no real compositor or pointer gating yet. Production original full host mask, default-off Aqua, Rust backend and `stable` remain unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 all synthetic minimal Qt probes were signal-terminated; classify retained plugin logs without rerun

- Owner ran a source-pinned `scripts/test-aqua-private-minimal-qs-bootstrap.py` at `SOURCE_SHA=284001594ca472ec6a098956754ad13bfa977e7a`: `AQUA_MINIMAL_QS_BOOTSTRAP_INERT_PASS`. Three ACTUAL standalone PRIVATE synthetic tests `OFFSCREEN_FILE`, `OFFSCREEN_DIRECTORY`, `MINIMAL_FILE` all reported `WRAPPER=NONZERO`, `QML_MARKER=NONE`, `QS_CHILD_EXIT=SIGNAL`, `ERROR_CLASSES=QT_PLATFORM_OR_PLUGIN,ABORT_OR_SIGNAL`, terminal `GATE=PRIVATE_MINIMAL_QS_BOOTSTRAP_CLASSIFIED`. Private evidence remains at the owner's reported `aqua-qt-state.*/hadalis/aqua-qt-motion.*/minimal-qs-bootstrap/{offscreen_file,offscreen_directory,minimal_file}/minimal.private.log`, not publicly uploaded. Do not infer a particular signal number, dynamic Aqua QML defect, plugin failure, or frame qualification from these coarse categories.
- SOURCE-RULE LIMITATION IDENTIFIED: Old `categorized_log()` considers the mere presence of the strings `qt.qpa` / `platform plugin` and `signal` / `fatal` to establish broad error category presence. `QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1` intentionally causes normal plugin-discovery diagnostic lines too (Qt official docs: `https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/debug.html`), so current broad error classes cannot themselves prove a broken Qt platform plugin. In the three tests, actual `qs` subprocess did return a negative signal-coded Python return code, which is distinct direct evidence of signal termination, but exact signal cause still unverified; old child stdout intentionally only printed `SIGNAL`.
- Staged a **NEW read-only POSTMORTEM** `scripts/aqua-private-minimal-boot-log-review.py` (Git blob `0557565ca81685aa7e1bf2a2fd820e0a58d9742c`) plus source-pinned synthetic benign-vs-fatal/privacy test `scripts/test-aqua-private-minimal-boot-log-review.py` (Git blob `6387deab8b9560a4a0a1fc89b9fa5a21b4df5655`). Both source-only, **NOT YET EXECUTED LOCAL**. Reader verifies the exact original source SHA and original previous runner blob, owner-owned private mode0700 scratch, safe known origin, bounded non-symlink files. It never starts Qt/Quickshell, reads only the three existing old minimal debug logs and reports static fields for actual byte count, newline/near512KiB-limit, fixed explicit fatal QPA/linker/QML/resource error patterns vs benign plugin discovery/loading, last six lines fixed classes, whether QML marker actually appears, whether the old child exit marker occurs uniquely and whether any explicit signal mnemonic appears in the raw private log. Does not print source lines, private paths, plugin identifiers, environment or arbitrary values. Raw logs remain owner-local; no docs receipt published.
- NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: from a NEW ephemeral read-only `dev` clone, require the exact two updated source blobs, run the inert source/test first and require `AQUA_MINIMAL_BOOT_LOG_REVIEW_INERT_PASS`. Only then read-only inspect previous retained scratch `/tmp/aqua-qt-state.rw21NC/hadalis/aqua-qt-motion.i0Yk7d` against original SHA `284001594ca472ec6a098956754ad13bfa977e7a`. The parsed actual plugin QPA/linking errors or near-limit status, rather than broad debug token matches, must drive the next repair. If still no explicit error in logs, do not speculate that the SIG originated in the plugin; consider a separate minimal signal-number-only traced probe after comparing previously retained control child/wrapper behavior. All Qt Aqua dynamic QML, real pointer and production Region gates still OPEN, original full-host mask and Aqua default-off unchanged, no `stable` edit.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 complete retained minimal Qt debug logs still lack explicit failures; exact signal gate staged

- Actual maintainer local synthetic inert contract `AQUA_MINIMAL_BOOT_LOG_REVIEW_INERT_PASS`. The exact three OLD retained private minimal Qt probe logs from source `284001594ca472ec6a098956754ad13bfa977e7a` were read-only classified: `OFFSCREEN_FILE` 13,221 bytes/350 lines, `OFFSCREEN_DIRECTORY` 13,226 bytes/350 lines, `MINIMAL_FILE` 10,280 bytes/277 lines. ALL three were not near their file-size limit, ended with newline, had NO QML component-completed marker, had `CHILD_EXIT=SIGNAL`, had no explicit signal mnemonic in their text and `FAILURES=NO_EXPLICIT_FAILURE_PATTERN`. Their permitted Qt events consist of `QT_PLUGIN_DISCOVERY`, standard Quickshell banners and the child-exit marker; neither successful plugin load nor explicit loader failure was identified by this classifier. Fixed last six category signatures were equal: UNCLASSIFIED, UNCLASSIFIED, QT_PLUGIN_DISCOVERY, QT_PLUGIN_DISCOVERY, UNCLASSIFIED, CHILD_EXIT_MARKER. GATE `READ_ONLY_EXISTING_MINIMAL_LOGS_CLASSIFIED`. Neither the old coarse `QT_PLATFORM_OR_PLUGIN` class nor the mere plugin-discovery lines prove plugin failure, and no stored diagnostic includes a genuine numeric signal code.
- In the previously reviewed minimal probe `scripts/aqua-private-minimal-qs-bootstrap.py` the code `child_exit_status(code)` deliberately collapses ANY negative `subprocess.run` return code into the same `SIGNAL` label. The old full file was read-only parsed, so exact -SIGNUM is unrecoverable from that private log; guessing SIGABRT/SIGSEGV would be unsupported. Historical actual frozen geometry PASS proves ONLY an earlier runtime succeeded, not this present offscreen runtime.
- Staged **NEW narrow explicit-opt-in PRIVATE minimal-ShellRoot signal probe** `scripts/aqua-private-qs-signal-gate.py` Git blob `2380e7c2a46569e8c21ca3f0c4cea0ac9441f61f` (commit `c00e91109b022bd4d778bb305e89916bc720ab41`) with inert synthetic source-pin/negative privacy test `scripts/test-aqua-private-qs-signal-gate.py` blob `0e9e053a74638197163594fd8149230b746f0a2c` (commit `c75f9db27290b1b27cd0eb7fa0b05541b8c2414e`). Both new files are SOURCE-STAGED, not yet run local. Borrow original frozen private-clone guards, frozen production QML source audit, exact older minimal fixture QML from `edd28683dc1ce679f24aa460e914cfad5abdc0a6`, exact local Quickshell 0.3.1 check, isolated offscreen `dbus-run-session` / no compositor environment, `--verbose` + `QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS=1` to replay ONE former failing `OFFSCREEN_FILE` test. Critically, the dedicated child writes ONLY `STATE=<enum>\nQS_SIGNAL=<fixed SIG name or NONE>\n` into a new mode0700 local-only sidecar in addition to separately bounded private debug stdout, so signal classification does not depend on truncated console output or the `dbus-run-session` wrapper's code. `RLIMIT_CORE=0` prevents sensitive crash dumps. Default `RLIMIT_FSIZE=524288` matches the earlier run. Only if actual QS child explicitly returned `SIGXFSZ`, automatically run ONE identical additional bounded 8MiB-fsize comparison with a fresh private DBus/XDG space; Linux documents SIGXFSZ as the result of exceeding RLIMIT_FSIZE (`https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getrlimit.2.html`). Other signal classes do NOT trigger extra Qt runs; do NOT infer the underlying root cause from the signal alone.
- NEXT SINGLE MAINTAINER LOCAL COMMAND: NEW mode0700 owned clean `dev` clone; exact-blob guard both staged script and test; run inert and assert `AQUA_PRIVATE_QS_SIGNAL_INERT_PASS`; then private explicit opt-in `python3 scripts/aqua-private-qs-signal-gate.py --acknowledge-private-qs-signal`. Return fixed `BASELINE_QS_STATE`, `BASELINE_QS_SIGNAL`, conditional control and `GATE` only. Keep user raw Qt logs, sidecar, QML path and state directory local. No dynamic Aqua geometry report or compositor pointer acceptance is proved by this standalone diagnostic; original production full-host Region, Aqua default-off, Rust backend and `stable` remain unchanged.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 exact QS signal inert blocked by stale string assertion; corrected

- Owner attempted the source-pinned private exact signal gate from previous `dev` state; the NEW inert test failed at line 69 on the source-spelling assertion `assert '"QS_SIGNAL=" + sig' in source`. The actual reviewed signal runner writes the correct sidecar format using `"STATE=" + state + "\\nQS_SIGNAL=" + sig + "\\n"`; the old grep omitted the preceding escaped newline. `set -e` stopped before the `EXACT SIGNAL DIAGNOSIS` private Quickshell launch. Therefore this attempt produced **NO Qt signal evidence**. The maintainer's previous minimal three control results (all child `SIGNAL`) and previous fully classified logs remain the last actual runtime evidence.
- Corrected ONLY `scripts/test-aqua-private-qs-signal-gate.py` (Git blob `5917d780c9933cd28484a4651bf342b1abeed003`, commits `772237875a6211519b8c44dd0f6dce4bc55cf194` and `0af7d81219f2646bb46bd7f6d4ccfa3eb9207a9c`) by replacing the brittle source-text assertion with mocked `subprocess.run` behavioral tests. Four cases exercise the real child function: `SIGXFSZ`, `SIGABRT`, exit 0 and ordinary nonzero, each checking actual sidecar format through `receipt_read`, child exit status and exact `--verbose --path` invocation without starting Quickshell. Source pin continues to require unchanged original actual signal runner blob `2380e7c2a46569e8c21ca3f0c4cea0ac9441f61f`; other existing negative, security, conditional-only SIGXFSZ checks retained. Source/branch static consistency was rechecked, but FULL new repo inert contract has **NOT** been rerun in the owner's local clone yet; do not mark it PASS from source review.
- NEXT ONE USER ACTION: new permission-private clean `dev` clone (concurrent MegaQML commits allowed, provided two exact file blobs unchanged); require signal runner `2380e7c2a46569e8c21ca3f0c4cea0ac9441f61f` and corrected inert test `5917d780c9933cd28484a4651bf342b1abeed003`, run `scripts/test-aqua-private-qs-signal-gate.py` first, then only on `AQUA_PRIVATE_QS_SIGNAL_INERT_PASS` run `scripts/aqua-private-qs-signal-gate.py --acknowledge-private-qs-signal`. It prints fixed `BASELINE_QS_STATE`, `BASELINE_QS_SIGNAL`, conditional-only `RAISED_LIMIT_*` if real `SIGXFSZ`, and `GATE`. Keep all raw logs/core/environment/private paths local. No source change to the production animation, Rust backend, Aqua default-off, full-host input mask or `stable`.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 owner-local 512 KiB SIGXFSZ proven; 8 MiB minimal Qt PASS; dynamic runner resource separation staged

- Owner actually ran exact-signal minimal startup probe from `SOURCE_SHA=294c29f8feafaf7960d1f654abb3236f324937d2`, first obtaining `AQUA_PRIVATE_QS_SIGNAL_INERT_PASS`. In isolated private minimal Quickshell offscreen with the SAME source-pinned original minimal ShellRoot QML, `RLIMIT_FSIZE=512 KiB` produced `BASELINE_QS_STATE=SIGNAL`, `BASELINE_QS_SIGNAL=SIGXFSZ`, `BASELINE_QML_MARKER=NONE_OR_UNVERIFIED`, `BASELINE_LOG_AT_LIMIT=NO`. The exact conditional control with independently isolated XDG/dbus and `RLIMIT_FSIZE=8 MiB` produced `RAISED_LIMIT_QS_STATE=ZERO`, `RAISED_LIMIT_QS_SIGNAL=NONE`, `RAISED_LIMIT_QML_MARKER=ONE`, `RAISED_LIMIT_LOG_AT_LIMIT=NO`, `GATE=PRIVATE_EXACT_QS_SIGNAL_OBSERVED`. This is direct evidence the inherited 512 KiB **process-wide file-size limit** prevented that minimal Quickshell fixture from initializing; it does NOT prove the specific underlying file that exceeded the limit (stdout log was not at the limit; QS internal/other private files may have been involved) and does NOT yet qualify full Aqua dynamic behavior or actual geometry.
- Previous dynamic runner `scripts/aqua-manual-offscreen-dynamic-geometry.py` used `resource.setrlimit(resource.RLIMIT_FSIZE, (MAX_LOG, MAX_LOG))` in the `dbus-run-session` child's preexec_fn with `MAX_LOG=524288`. The cap is INHERITED by all Quickshell descendant writes, not an isolated stdout quota, providing a source-grounded explanation consistent with earlier pre-BOOT nonzero child and banner-only logs; the new exact proof was conducted only on the synthetic minimal control. Keep all former failed dynamic results `INCONCLUSIVE`; avoid overclaiming a successful full dynamic gate.
- Corrected ONLY the PRIVATE dynamic offscreen probe runner on `dev` (blob `fe1c828e7c2f0e4fdc4bb7340242062085db3118`, commits `11ec60846184a646c064af725e461984eb5aeec9` and `18fa09cc67849af118ebd143cbc090ca46eab76b`). Separate `MAX_LOG=524288` (postrun stdout/stderr evidence cap) from `QS_CHILD_FILE_LIMIT=8*1024*1024` (inherited private QS regular-file cap, empirical minimal PASS). The private preexec function `limit_private_process_files()` now sets `RLIMIT_CORE=(0,0)` (prevent crash core dumps) and `RLIMIT_FSIZE=(8MiB,8MiB)`; original postrun check still rejects a stdout log over 512 KiB and original stage/source/private-cleanup/receipt guards remain unchanged. The original production Rust backend, dynamic QML fixture, default-off Aqua, full-host input Region and `stable` are untouched. These numbers do NOT guarantee all future QML log or dynamic animation loads under 8MiB; fail closed and inspect safe stages after one local run.
- Updated companion inert test `scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-dynamic-geometry-contract.py` (blob `ad1f97cec8c30ecbdd447ec3bc8ddd0070a17b7b`, commit `60d7f58a98034740f6514620969cfda4ad1f1ca8`) pins the exact updated runner, proves separate 512KiB/8MiB constants, mocks `resource.setrlimit` to assert BOTH core=0 and exact new fsize bounds without changing host process limits, and still explicitly requires a postrun `0 < log.stat().st_size <= MAX_LOG` check plus all original synthetic geometry, stage order and private redaction constraints. THIS CORRECTED TEST HAS NOT YET RUN on the owner's machine; source-only GitHub checks are not local PASS.
- **NEXT**: ONE freshly permission-private owner-owned mode0700 clean `dev` clone, exact Git blob guards for both updated files `fe1c828e7c2f0e4fdc4bb7340242062085db3118` and `ad1f97cec8c30ecbdd447ec3bc8ddd0070a17b7b` plus original QML fixture source pin `6e3b5402d32d263868c1ec688925adba0fd7250b`. Run inert first and require `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS` at printed `SOURCE_SHA`; only then with explicit owner opt-in run `scripts/aqua-manual-offscreen-dynamic-geometry.py --acknowledge-private-offscreen-dynamic-motion`. Print ONLY allowlisted `PRIVATE_QS_EXIT_CLASS`, `PRIVATE_QML_STAGES`, `PRIVATE_QML_LAST_STAGE`, `PRIVATE_QML_FAILURE_CATEGORY`, `STOP`, `AQUA_QT_DYNAMIC_RESULT`, `REPORT_PUBLISHED`; keep private Qt logs and coordinates local. Report status PASS only on real all-12 witness acceptance and published sanitized receipt, not on inert/source proof. A full source/desktop/Niri/pointer/production-mask acceptance is STILL a separate gate.


## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 first full dynamic Qt stages complete, private parser still INCONCLUSIVE; read-only postmortem staged

- Owner ran corrected 8MiB-fsize `dev` runner at `SOURCE_SHA=4caccd2058f1b3089ec398a131241f800eaae890`; `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS`. ACTUAL private offscreen dynamic Qt process reported `PRIVATE_QS_EXIT_CLASS=ZERO`, all `PRIVATE_QML_STAGES=8`, `PRIVATE_QML_LAST_STAGE=SAMPLING_DONE`, then `STOP: private_dynamic_qml_parser_inconclusive`, runner exit 1 and `GATE=UNVERIFIED`. The owner preserved original private log and clean private repo in its original 0700 scratch. This directly proves the source-authored BOOT/SETUP/FROZEN/NEUTRAL/STRETCH/RELEASE/DONE Qt stage sequence was observed for the QML fixture. It does **NOT** prove that all 12 hosts supplied valid frozen flags, that parsed JSON is complete, that individual motion witness booleans are TRUE, that 12-case dynamic model validation passed, or that the end-to-end dynamic gate has been accepted. No dynamic receipt was published.
- Source-level review of original runner at blob `fe1c828e7c2f0e4fdc4bb7340242062085db3118`: `private_dynamic_qml_parser_inconclusive` merges **three distinct** failure categories inside ONE try block: `json.loads(single geometry marker)` JSON decode, `known_frozen()` frozen-reference I/O/content validity, `model_summary(rows, baseline)` 12-host structural/type/witness-reference validation. A normal `INCONCLUSIVE` motion witness returned by `model_summary()` would NOT raise here, so treating this as a motion-frame failure without examining the private retained marker is premature. Original fixture remains unchanged and all stage markers complete.
- Created independent, NON-PUBLISHING, READ-ONLY private postmortem `scripts/aqua-private-dynamic-parser-postmortem.py` exact Git blob `73904dbda1de437a8586925d32fa774af6b04d5e` (commit `d5f31df3872ffe6fbb31e7a87e8fd2103f86de50`) with inert synthetic privacy/shape/JSON/exception tests `scripts/test-aqua-private-dynamic-parser-postmortem.py` blob `aa6fff8e52471fd876c7c4249deb6bd810e71aa8` (commit `896049d03b8090ae168bdc86c300ef1e5318c5fc`). These two NEW sources are staged on `dev` but NOT YET RUN locally. The postmortem requires the exact original retained clean clone source `4caccd2058f1b3089ec398a131241f800eaae890`, old dynamic runner blob `fe1c828e7c2f0e4fdc4bb7340242062085db3118`, original dynamic QML fixture blob `6e3b5402d32d263868c1ec688925adba0fd7250b`, owner/mode0700 scratch and safe original remote; it imports the OLD runner inertly and reads ONLY the old already-retained 512KiB-bounded `dynamic.private.log`. Output contains only fixed stage/marker counts, payload character count/bracket classifications, fixed JSON host/phase key shape enums and strictly allowlisted parser/frozen reference/structural validation ValueError names, never raw JSON, coordinates, QML error text, private filenames, desktop data or original log lines. It does not run Quickshell, touch repo/desktop, publish docs or change source pins. Its classification is DIAGNOSIS, NOT a fabricated dynamics receipt.
- NEXT SINGLE LOCAL ACTION: fresh ephemeral read-only `dev` clone; verify BOTH postmortem and inert exact Git blobs; run `scripts/test-aqua-private-dynamic-parser-postmortem.py` and require `AQUA_PRIVATE_DYNAMIC_PARSER_POSTMORTEM_INERT_PASS` before executing read-only `scripts/aqua-private-dynamic-parser-postmortem.py --scratch /tmp/aqua-qt-state.TwSIa1/hadalis/aqua-qt-motion.y2aZdO`. Return only categorical result and `GATE`. Then use direct evidence to fix the narrow cause: JSON decode/shape errors require payload framing or original fixture review; frozen-reference error requires reference audit; model parser error requires specific allowlisted model field correction. Do NOT rerun a full private Qt dynamic sweep before isolating existing failure, nor modify original production Aqua mask, Rust backend, default-off Aqua or `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 retained dynamic parser scale-key mismatch

- Owner postmortem at old source `4caccd2058f1b3089ec398a131241f800eaae890`: 8 expected stages, one geometry marker, valid 12-case JSON and valid frozen reference, then `MODEL_CATEGORY=missing_scale_frozen_reference`. No motion PASS inferred.
- Source analysis: JavaScript JSON serializes scale 1.0 as integer 1; Python accepts numeric equality but original `str(scale)` looks up `"1"` where pinned frozen reference uses `"1.0"`. This is the specific first-failure mechanism.
- Staged narrow private-runner scale normalization: runner blob `9cab00fca46212c819ac7308cfc0d6923d1139d3` commit `9c2a280d5cf2902f17b39e911f5ff5b05faaaee2`; inert contract regression blob `023cdaccd9d0f8234b9dea0b4fb1bdc43c1c3754` commit `86b6c29cc64e1aa5070e0aaef8f8127e9f27cdba`. No local test on these updated blobs yet. Fixture, backend, production mask, Aqua default-off and `stable` untouched.
- NEXT: in a new clean mode0700 `dev` clone, verify exact runner and inert blobs; run updated inert and only if PASS read-only reclassify the retained old private log with the new parser and existing pinned `owner_guard`. Print only allowlisted categories, no Qt rerun and no raw log export. This is old-sample reclassification, not broad animation acceptance.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 owner reclassified OLD actual Qt log PASS with corrected parser; bounded receipt publication staged

- Owner executed source- and blob-pinned clean `dev` private recheck at `DEV_HEAD=caeffb6ea25fb033d49544910b4917d87bc144c0`: `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_DYNAMIC_PARSER_POSTMORTEM_INERT_PASS`. Read-only existing original private Qt log from `SOURCE_SHA=4caccd2058f1b3089ec398a131241f800eaae890` showed `STAGES=8`, correct ordered stages, exactly one geometry marker, valid 9858-character JSON, correct TWELVE_HOSTS/host and phase fields, valid frozen reference, `PARSER_STAGE=MODEL_VALIDATED`, `MODEL_STATUS=pass`, `GATE=READ_ONLY_CORRECTED_PARSER_CLASSIFIED`. This proves corrected parser acceptance of the retained real Qt sampled motion data, NOT re-execution of Qt, full motion extrema, compositor input Region acceptance or shell production qualification.
- Source fix runner blob `9cab00fca46212c819ac7308cfc0d6923d1139d3`, inert regression blob `023cdaccd9d0f8234b9dea0b4fb1bdc43c1c3754`, retained original fixture blob `6e3b5402d32d263868c1ec688925adba0fd7250b`, pinned original frozen receipt blob `dc2f36b525ef7e412869f155153dc4e48720f898` remain unchanged. No full `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-*.json` automatic runner receipt was published for the original execution.
- STAGED NEW separate opt-in PRIVATE retrospective receipt publisher `scripts/aqua-publish-retained-dynamic-receipt.py` Git blob `9b6fb909125da110266fb303bdcced6b9fdea7ed`, commit `4a56b629809df4860f6ab1eeec4ea3c6fa2762bf`, and inert synthetic privacy/negative-contract `scripts/test-aqua-retained-dynamic-receipt-contract.py` Git blob `06bbc5fb457b1aea99b1ef6f277ead7c332437a1`, commit `a23c67805bb25bfb36da825a71d6a84b3535f916`. Not owner-local tested yet. Script checks clean private `dev` clone and exact Aqua blobs, reuses original old-log `owner_guard`, checks all expected stages/exactly one geometry marker/no failure markers, runs fixed `model_summary`, then publishes ONLY the bounded existing `public_report` categorical projection augmented with EXPLICIT retrospective/non-rerun provenance to deterministic `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-retained-4caccd2058f1-scale-parser.json`. It uses a one-shot NONFORCE push, no rebase/retry, fail-closed on concurrent dev changes. Never launches Qt or touches original old scratch.
- NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: in a new mode0700 private clean `dev` clone, check exact publisher/test/runner blobs plus pinned fixture/reference, run updated `scripts/test-aqua-offscreen-dynamic-geometry-contract.py` and NEW retained receipt inert test first. Only if both PASS, run `python3 scripts/aqua-publish-retained-dynamic-receipt.py --acknowledge-retained-publication`. Print only fixed `SOURCE_SHA`, `MODEL_STATUS`, `OBSERVED_HOST_CASES`, `NEW_QT_RUN`, `PUBLICATION_COMMIT`, `REPORT_PUBLISHED`, `GATE`; if remote moves or old evidence is unavailable, abort without claiming publication. Re-read GitHub only after result to verify published report and advance to independent live pointer/spring/resource acceptance. Do NOT change original production full-host mask, default-off Aqua, Rust or `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 retrospective dynamic Qt receipt published; painted host boundary next

- Owner launched the staged one-command publication in a clean private `dev` clone and reported both `AQUA_OFFSCREEN_DYNAMIC_INERT_CONTRACT_PASS` and `AQUA_RETAINED_DYNAMIC_RECEIPT_INERT_PASS`. Its next reported `DEV_HEAD=556e7643bca1f672feef6ed5d879ffff73f861c4` and `GATE=RECEIPT_ALREADY_EXISTS` were NOT a new parser/model failure: exact subsequent GitHub verification proved the previous run had ALREADY pushed the intended SINGLE receipt in the direct child commit `556e7643bca1f672feef6ed5d879ffff73f861c4`, with exactly one added file, `docs/aqua-qt-dynamic-retained-4caccd2058f1-scale-parser.json` Git blob `54a153d717b10056d156e4724d80cb759cf5941d`. Do not rerun publisher or create a second receipt; stop-on-existing was correct idempotent refusal.
- AUTHENTIC PUBLISHED RETROSPECTIVE REPORT: old actual Qt source `4caccd2058f1b3089ec398a131241f800eaae890`, corrected parser blob `9cab00fca46212c819ac7308cfc0d6923d1139d3`, `status=pass`, `all_12_edge_scale_state_witnesses=true`, 80 actual old saved-frame samples per case/phase and no unqualified edge-scale entries. Qt was NOT rerun; original QS exit ZERO is owner-reported rather than reconstructed from the retained log. The old published frozen 24-pose reference remains unchanged.
- NEW EVIDENCE for next design: for each of three scales (0.65/1.0/1.5), the OR-ed sampled body-item BBOX is outside host for TOP/BOTTOM and exceeds corresponding frozen BBOX for ALL FOUR edge placements during BOTH stretch and release. Mapped nominal path-tip is beyond TOP host in STRETCH only. This is NOT proof that painted Bézier body pixels or their interactive target cross the host: full per-frame coordinates/alpha/clipping and compositor pointer delivery were not measured. Static four-edge size=1 BBOX click PASS is not a viable standalone dynamic mask guarantee. Keep `global_spring_extrema_proven=false`, `native_backend_traces=not_run`, `wayland_pointer_hover=not_run`, `canonical_validation=not_run`.
- Updated the existing technical research in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` in commit `25316ce6c8215400578d1331206f7b6340ae0778`. NEXT SOURCE TASK: design and source-stage an independent, source-pinned PRIVATE offscreen painted-core-vs-host boundary probe (expanded capture canvas, sampled actual QML, separate core/stroke vs halo/ripple, strict no-coordinates sanitizer and negative tests). If core/decor separation requires a shadow-only altered renderer, label and validate that shadow scope separately; never call it identical production renderer. This source task itself does not authorize running Qt, starting Niri, publishing raw screenshots, widening or shrinking the production mask, enabling Aqua, or touching `stable`. Only after source/inert review should ONE bounded owner-local test command be issued. A separate nested pointer+underlay proof and backend replay remain future independent gates.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 fake-only painted-alpha model staged ahead of Qt capture

- New first-stage implementation of the NEXT painted-core/host research: `scripts/aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py` blob `fa9e7c2af87ee830336988fa7060e2720e816ed0` (initial commit `6f66406a3913f1ee6c26f587d89568707553bd1b`, PNG signature correction `8d7207ec27b392b56069124f4bf3cfc51031527e`). Pure-inert bounded PNG RGBA8 decoder with all five filter types, anti-fabrication phase/mapped-motion/host-rectangle checks, transparent canvas edge/truncation rejection and categorical 48-slot 4-edge × 3-scale × 2-phase × 2-source aggregation, NO Qt, filesystem access, stdout pixels or source/production edits. It STRICTLY distinguishes an unchanged FULL-companion composite from a separate shadow-only body assembly; it cannot infer that composited exterior alpha belongs to Aqua's clickable core.
- Added synthetic-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py` blob `f673e062669d5b03f7af5bd74c20c5126b37e9be` (first commit `62298a20f7b0c578adc6ddc6a8a8d63073842e82`, oversized-fixture correction `23ce6d0836ac0c6514522ca37f1bd4951d6edd17`). Negative test includes transparent pixels, anti-alias threshold/edge crop, invalid PNG/chunk/filter and data shape, strict no private fields and duplicate case coverage. Source-staged NOT OWNER-LOCAL TESTED YET; do NOT claim alpha observations exist, Qt capture works or full 48-slot dynamic motion passes.
- Detailed gate in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` (commit `1e4274beb27b96cd46654a454e96afcb80dc6061`). NEXT EXACT OWNER ACTION: new mode0700 clean read-only `dev` clone with exact two blob guards; run only `python3 -B scripts/test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py`, require `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`. No Qt or old log re-run. After that, source-stage one-case bounded offscreen original-companion transparent `grabToImage` canary in a new private runner and fake contract to verify Qt capture/format without presupposing full 48-case frame budget. Only afterward develop full paired 48-case capture. Other pointer, native backend, popup, multitarget/fractional/long-term and canonical gates remain open. No production mask or default-off change; do not edit `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 painted-alpha inert PASS, isolated one-case Qt paint canary source staged

- OWNER LOCAL RESULT at `DEV_HEAD=19408521c6927de57ba74163a3001fc67e6f2dc1`: `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`, `QT_EXECUTED=NO`, `PRODUCTION_CHANGED=NO`, `GATE=PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_VERIFIED`. This qualifies only the fake-only PNG decoder, privacy/shape regressions. No actual Qt image or paint-pixel evidence existed at that checkpoint.
- NEW SOURCE-STAGED one-case PRIVATE Qt `grabToImage` feasibility: original unchanged `AbyssCompanion`/`WaterDropletBody` at TOP scale 1 and privately fixed stretch pose inside a hidden-then-shown transparent 320×300 offscreen `FloatingWindow` with extra room around the 112×98 host. Fixture `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-alpha-canary/shell.qml` exact blob `4ed1c92b81870197927b449cfe60cd2c57859b30`. This is a static capture/format feasibility test, NOT an actual dynamic frame, core-specific rendered-pixel measurement, real Wayland clipping, input Region or host screenshot.
- Guarded script `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paint-canary.py` blob `5ce5155303913b9eda49590ba017c074b8e176fc`: owner-owned clean mode0700 `dev` scratch, exact stable Aqua fixture/production/config/parser pins, private D-Bus/XDG/Qt offscreen, stripped host Wayland/Niri/display/session bus, v0.3.1 Quickshell check, bounded Qt process group/capture time/file sizes and private-only PNG/log. Only `OUTSIDE_HOST_COMPOSITE_ALPHA` categorical result can escape; even YES cannot distinguish paint of body from halo/ripple. No Git publishing, no source mutation.
- New separate fake-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-paint-canary-contract.py` blob `2c4a98c61c42e21634d568e68d10d8ac452f21f1`: exact source-pin/static env/cleanup constraints; synthetic private PNG interior, exterior, blank, edge-cropped and malformed validations. Neither this NEW test nor actual canary has yet run owner-local. Design instructions appended to existing `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` in commit `67d56026b171a5759fcb7ae85dee3b8499f62efa`.
- NEXT EXACT OWNER ACTION: issue ONE ephemeral clean `dev` clone command with explicit new fixture/runner/contract and old model/production blob verification; run previous `test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py` and new `test-aqua-private-paint-canary-contract.py` fake-only first, requiring BOTH expected PASS markers. ONLY on these two PASS and explicit owner-local command consent run ONE `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paint-canary.py --acknowledge-private-one-case-capture`. Fail closed on unsupported Qt image type, insufficient original painted pixels, file limits, capture timeout, unexpected status, source drift or missing owned cleanup. Do not expand to full 48-case sampling without separately reviewing the observed one-case feasibility evidence. Never modify original full-host production mask, default-off Aqua, original Rust backend or `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 private actual full-companion painted-alpha canary PASS; body-only shadow staged

- Owner successfully executed the source-pinned FIRST actual Qt composite canary at `SOURCE_SHA=63eb572bdf324f1fd437df6f87617a2b9a81cbaa`, reporting `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINT_CANARY_INERT_PASS`, `ACTUAL_UNMODIFIED_COMPANION=YES`, `STATIC_TOP_SCALE1_PNG=VALID`, `OUTSIDE_HOST_COMPOSITE_ALPHA=YES`, `BODY_SPECIFIC_PAINT_OUTSIDE_HOST=UNPROVEN`, `DYNAMIC_WITNESS=NOT_RUN`, `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`, `GATE=PRIVATE_OFFSCREEN_ONE_CASE_CAPTURE_VERIFIED`. This is one exact-source real OFFSCREEN Qt composite painted-alpha existence observation outside TOP host at scale1 in the frozen private test pose; not core/stroke attribution, compositor clipping or live interaction.
- NEXT ISOLATION staged on `dev`: `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-alpha-shadow/shell.qml` exact blob `feea498f8b75c24cdd93fe116bac0dd6b36b1d01` directly instantiates the UNMODIFIED `WaterDropletBody` at source-matched TOP/scale1/frozen stretch transform in a 112×98 shadow host inside its own 320×300 transparent offscreen capture stage, omitting original `AbyssCompanion` external cradle. It is an explicitly ALTERNATE shadow assembly, not production; the body's own face/highlights remain, internal halo pulse set zero.
- `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paint-shadow.py` exact blob `08670b15307115adf8432614bdb13b36071effe0` source-pins Aqua production files, old successful full-composite canary and fixture, new shadow fixture and alpha parser. It preserves the 0700 clean `dev` clone, privately isolated Qt offscreen/XDG/D-Bus, source review, bounded 13s subprocess/8MiB child files/256KiB private log and strict group cleanup. Publishes NO PNG or Git file; prints fixed categorical result. `scripts/test-aqua-private-paint-shadow-contract.py` blob `c52562657920f7c0a2bfd88f5dbe8974aa590261` is NEW fake-only inert source/PNG/isolation test; both new artifacts have NOT YET run owner-local. Detailed implications and next gate appended in existing `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md`, commit `cf5f2a54eaba207175baf9c74e09e44a7877f3fc`.
- NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: fresh, strictly private mode0700 clean `dev` clone, check shadow fixture/runner/inert exact blobs AND original canary and alpha model pins. Run existing fake-only painted alpha test and new shadow fake-only test first; only after both PASS run ONE `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paint-shadow.py --acknowledge-private-one-case-shadow`. Return strictly categorical `SHADOW_OUTSIDE_HOST_ALPHA` and `GATE`, keep raw log/capture local and auto-cleaned. If failure, classify from fixed GATE before any repeat. The old composite capture must NOT be rerun for this independent shadow feasibility. A shadow YES does NOT yet prove production core paint or actual Wayland hit-region reach; a shadow NO does NOT prove the earlier composite pixel was cradle without synchronized capture. Keep original full-host input Region, default-off Aqua and `stable` unchanged.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 body-shadow outside-host alpha PASS; original ShapePath-only Qt canary staged

- OWNER ran exact-source one-case body-only SHADOW canary at `SOURCE_SHA=81daf8f7e64d1a7521d18f831d4db30044a10c74`: `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINT_SHADOW_INERT_PASS`, original UNMODIFIED `WaterDropletBody` standalone no external `AbyssCompanion` cradle, static TOP scale1 PNG VALID, `SHADOW_OUTSIDE_HOST_ALPHA=YES`, `PRODUCTION_BODY_PAINT_OUTSIDE_HOST=UNPROVEN`, `BODY_SHAPE_VS_INTERNAL_CHILDREN=UNRESOLVED`, `DYNAMIC_WITNESS=NOT_RUN`, `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`, `GATE=PRIVATE_ONE_CASE_SHADOW_CLASSIFIED`. The shadow result means the external cradle was NOT necessary for observed exterior alpha in this altered source-pinned PRIVATE assembly. It cannot attribute the outside pixels to the original Bézier path vs internal highlights/eyes/mouth or certify original production clipping/clicking, no dynamic output.
- New source-staged NEXT private isolation: original unmodified Aqua body **only its exact original full-size Bézier ShapePath child rendered**, with its original gradient and stroke; hide remaining 4 visual siblings (internal halo, specular highlight, eyes, mouth) on a private child instance after a strict expected five-child/one-full-size-child runtime gate and a `Qt.callLater` visibility checkpoint. DO NOT edit production source. Fixture `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-alpha-core/shell.qml` blob `eb35bd8366a0d2b274302a02eff089b5507bf3db` commit `4b129b7a0aea19791d93a1671d4679244c2e584a`. It is an intentionally ALTERED child-visibility shadow, not identical original production.

- NEXT single owner-local action: a new clean 0700 disposable `dev` clone, exact Git blob guards on fixture/runner/test and prior alpha/shadow/production sources; run existing `scripts/test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py` followed by new `scripts/test-aqua-private-paint-core-contract.py` fake-only, requiring exact PASS markers.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 real original Bézier core outside-host alpha PASS; paired full/core canary staged

- OWNER REAL LOCAL result at `SOURCE_SHA=be781816c44177ffce279c32edf052ae38105243`: previously pinned painted-alpha model, body-shadow and ORIGINAL Bézier-core inert contracts ALL PASS, then single private static TOP scale1 Qt original-body fixture with all four NON-core visual siblings hidden recorded `STATIC_TOP_SCALE1_CORE_PNG=VALID`, `CORE_OUTSIDE_HOST_ALPHA=YES`, `ORIGINAL_SHAPEPATH_CHILD=SOURCE_PINNED`, `SHAPE_STROKE_INCLUDED=YES`, `PRODUCTION_CORE_PAINT_OUTSIDE_HOST=UNPROVEN`, `DYNAMIC_WITNESS=NOT_RUN`, `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`, `GATE=PRIVATE_ONE_CASE_CORE_CLASSIFIED`. The original Bézier ShapePath/stroke alone emits exterior alpha in this ALTERED PRIVATE scene. Original production composite exact paint at SAME pixel, host clipping and pointer Region remain unqualified. Retired preceding Qt canaries must NOT be rerun merely to compare their non-synchronized old screenshots.
- Staged NEXT single-session source-pinned FIXED-POSE private full+core A/B to verify whether SAME exterior alpha pixels appear in both within one Quickshell instance without any original source changes. `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-alpha-paired/shell.qml` blob `83326999c8363420fabb5bbb5022d100ab1a64c6` commit `11adf02e23226d3fffe0db8555cf561d4b5ad209`: one exact original `AbyssCompanion` with `WaterDropletBody`, full composite grab FIRST after freezing own instance and five-visual-child/source-geometry check. Only after full save hide four non-core body visual siblings, require same mapped pose throughout both grabs, then core-only grab; capture private 320x300 stage, NEVER desktop. Source original modules and production mask unmodified. The latter image remains an altered private scene, not a simultaneous original production frame.

New runner borrows and pins prior production/Qt/PNG source-identity safety; preserves 0700 clean current `dev` clone, private offscreen/own D-Bus/XDG, 8MiB files, 256KiB log, one 14s capture process and strict group cleanup, NO publication. Validates two independent PNGs and returns ONLY categorical `COMPOSITE_OUTSIDE_HOST_ALPHA`, `CORE_OUTSIDE_HOST_ALPHA` and `SAME_PIXEL_EXTERIOR_OVERLAP`. Fake test covers shared vs separate exterior alpha, one-sided alpha, blank/edge corruption and fixed allowlisted stages. New components source-staged, NOT owner-local tested nor Qt run yet. Technical acceptance research appended to `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `a2293af12c7dc37add88ff2069c7f01425194260`.
- NEXT EXACT OWNER ACTION: ONE fresh clean 0700 private `dev` clone, verify exact newly staged fixture/runner/test plus the unchanged old alpha-model/production/core pins, run existing fake-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py` and NEW fake-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-paint-paired-contract.py` first; only if both PASS, run ONE opted-in `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paint-paired.py --acknowledge-private-paired-static-core`. Return only allowlisted result categories or single failure `GATE`. A YES/YES/YES adds evidence of the source-original core and full composite exterior overlap at ONE privately fixed TOP scale1 pose; NO is INCONCLUSIVE for absence elsewhere. Still need real compositor clip/input proof, controlled dynamic painted-frame sampling across all edges/scales, true backend state replay and production visual/resource/canonical qualification. No alteration of production host input mask, Aqua default-off, Rust or `stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 TOP paired alpha overlap PASS; corrected twelve-case static matrix source staged

- OWNER REAL LOCAL Qt source-pinned same-session single TOP scale1 PAIR from `SOURCE_SHA=27430b931de91ef63eec1caddc6f6c9822158f7a`: existing alpha and paired contracts BOTH PASS; `ACTUAL_UNMODIFIED_COMPANION=YES`, `SAME_QT_SESSION=YES`, `FIXED_MAPPED_POSE=YES`, `PRIVATE_CORE_CHILDREN_HIDDEN=YES`, `COMPOSITE_OUTSIDE_HOST_ALPHA=YES`, `CORE_OUTSIDE_HOST_ALPHA=YES`, `SAME_PIXEL_EXTERIOR_OVERLAP=YES`, `EXACT_PRODUCTION_PAINT_AND_CLICK=NOT_PROVEN`, `DYNAMIC_WITNESS=NOT_RUN`, `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`, `GATE=PRIVATE_PAIRED_STATIC_CORE_CLASSIFIED`. That proves same exterior pixel overlap between the original FULL scene and a modified second scene on the SAME original instance, at ONE fixed pose, but does not prove the original renderer specifically paints that source Bézier pixel outside a real compositor host.
- IMPORTANT RESEARCH CORRECTION: direct old paired fixture review discovered `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-alpha-paired/shell.qml` hid the four non-core `WaterDropletBody` visual siblings ONLY; the original `AbyssCompanion` external cradle `Rectangle` remained visible in its second image. Thus the old `SAME_PIXEL_EXTERIOR_OVERLAP=YES` is NOT uniquely source-core-attributable despite independently corroborated exterior alpha from prior stand-alone source-core-only PRIVATE shadow test. Do NOT erase/rewrite the honest old output or misstate its cause. The NEW static matrix fixture specifically fixes this causal confound by also hiding/validating/restoring the external cradle for its second exposure; original production files stay unchanged.
- NEW source-staged strict STATIC 12-case four-edge × .65/1.0/1.5 paired matrix:

Fake-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-paired-static-matrix-contract.py` blob `280a921232bfc3295c1cf8c06e3bf8eac4f8be2b`, commit `160036dacb9737b7129edbf2205981f13eeb7d1f`, has all twelve fake case slots, overlapping/disjoint/exterior one-sided/transparent/invalid and privacy/missing/duplicate negative tests.
  - `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-static-matrix/shell.qml` CURRENT corrected blob `4860f504cff167e806afe8217d73201012b7d278`, commit `27913f7aba1dcca6e08c77220232f6372e4486e0`, uses ONE original actual `AbyssCompanion` reused for all twelve host edge/scale cases in ONE private Qt session; verify source geometry and source five BODY visual children plus unique original external cradle, grab full scene, HIDE both external cradle and other four BODY visuals, verify mapped pose unchanged and grab original Bézier child/stroke only, then restore all siblings and cradle BEFORE next case. STRICT 62-stage fixed enum, no raw coordinates/capture output. Any source/child topology/pose/canvas/save failure aborts. This is sequential and intentionally altered scene, NEVER equivalent to two simultaneous production render passes.
  - Strict owned mode0700 clean-`dev` cloned runner `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paired-static-matrix.py` CURRENT blob `fee5944e8fe9fb40a38da24edd104ef78ef32496`, commit `c2f2eaa8d165ad460c3cbccd2ec54d5ef22b362d`, recursively source-pins reviewed original QML, previous private runner and new classifier/fixture, isolates own XDG/D-Bus/offscreen Qt v0.3.1, bounds 65s fixture and 75s process, group cleanup, 8MiB per-child-file, private log 256 KiB, exactly 24 owned 0600 PNG each <=1MiB, strict parser and ONLY categorical case flags F/C/O for all twelve cases, no Git publishing or screenshots.

- Detailed scope and correction appended to existing `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `8cd527d1add8110e108b2d4fece6586436fa1a12`. New classifier, fixture, runner and new fake-only tests SOURCE STAGED; NONE of these new matrix tests nor the 12-case actual Qt fixture has been executed owner-local. No production mask, Aqua default-off, original QML, Rust or `stable` edits.
- NEXT EXACT OWNER ACTION: ONE fresh mode0700 trusted clean `dev` clone with exact NEW five file blob pins plus old alpha/model, paired source and production QML pins. Run `scripts/test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py`, `scripts/test-aqua-private-paired-static-matrix-contract.py` and `scripts/test-aqua-private-static-matrix-runner-contract.py` fake-only FIRST. Only if all three PASS, opt in to one bounded private Qt full 12-case test `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paired-static-matrix.py --acknowledge-private-static-paired-matrix` in same disposable clone; return strict 12 per-case categorical F/C/O outputs or one failure GATE. On any failure stop; do not fallback to old confounded paired snapshot or loosen source guards. Even matrix PASS leaves dynamic painted motion, compositor clip/input, native backend, popup interference, fractional/multioutput/long-run and canonical gates separate.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 corrected static matrix actual PASS; two-case dynamic composite painted pilot staged

- OWNER just executed the new corrected 12×2 static original-QML full versus isolated original-Bézier `ShapePath` canvas captures at `SOURCE_SHA=d4d06e053c5cceb21a0fb72ba12d0245334d9f87`. ALL `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAIRED_STATIC_MATRIX_INERT_PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_STATIC_MATRIX_RUNNER_INERT_PASS`, `GATE=PRIVATE_STATIC_PAIRED_MATRIX_CLASSIFIED` with `PAIRED_STATIC_HOST_CASES=12`, `SAME_QT_SESSION=YES`, `SAME_POSE_WITHIN_EACH_PAIR=YES`. Exterior alpha by each scale is EXACTLY: TOP [.65=F0C0O0,1.0=F1C1O1,1.5=F1C1O1]; RIGHT [000,000,000]; BOTTOM [000,000,F1C0O0]; LEFT [000,000,000]. Flags F=full original composite painted exterior; C=original source Bézier+stroke alone in sibling+external-cradle-hidden PRIVATE state; O=same exterior pixel in both sequential captures on same instance. These are 12 FROZEN stretch=1 samples only; zeros DO NOT prove global absence through moving spring/other states. BOTTOM×1.5 F1C0 means the original full composite has exterior pixels in that state while the isolated original core does not; exact source of non-core pixels is unproven.
- NEXT chosen source task: TWO-case `TOP×1.0` (static FCO111) and `BOTTOM×1.5` (static F100) **actual-QML full composite moving painted-alpha pilot** before any wider moving/core pair matrix. No alteration of production original component, cradle/halo or hit region. New inert `scripts/aqua-private-dynamic-paint-pilot-model.py` blob `9ecde49a0d2f77e8fcb6f2d9309978945ef33d8c` commit `8353b8ee05e997ffa62ff112895a95d2017b7465`: exactly 8 ORIGINAL FULL-COMPOSITE actual PNGs per case per real stretch/release phase (2×2×8=32), 320x300 independently captured scene for each case, strict source-pinned old RGBA8 decoder, finite center-scaled geometry, empty 2px image boundary, minimum 8 interior painted pixels, categorical exterior observed per case+phase plus mandatory actual-QML source-gated phase/mapped-movement/target reach witnesses. Never substitutes mapped geometry AABB for actual pixel observations.
- Private actual unmodified original QML fixture `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-dynamic-pilot/shell.qml` blob `1f840534e93ff46deb401e52a3eb56cda09a807c`, commit `466cd3d9b505699d7a3964a62d2883d418f60509`: one private Qt session with TWO self-owned transparent offscreen-only windows; each has exact original full companion TOP×1 or BOTTOM×1.5. Neutralizes private pose, activates original authored `SpringAnimation` motion, starts stretch=1, sequentially captures each case at eight 350ms-separated sample indices, then triggers release=0 and repeats. Requires active motion/finite original mapped body corners, per-case sampled mapped geometry changes in BOTH phases, verified target-reaching and strict stage markers. Aborts on failure/38s in-fixture timeout. Images never include host screen or any external window.
- New strict runner `scripts/aqua-manual-private-dynamic-paint-pilot.py` CORRECTED blob `fbab844181f308019287ce06f61c106f4e5bf35c`, initial commit `526beecb61c79b5afa78b2319c1f0ab90166870d`, safe filename-stem correction `57e7252a1c42cfe916ca8119dc19664076e23dfa`: exact prior trusted private clean mode0700 `dev` owner-only clone guard and original Aqua QML/style/defaults/PNG parser pins, locally verified Quickshell 0.3.1, private isolated per-job XDG+D-Bus, host Wayland/Niri/display/session-bus env removed, one bounded 48s Qt child in own group with strict post-run group cleanup, 8MiB inherited file cap, private log<=256KiB, exactly 32 owner-owned 0600 PNG files each <=1MiB. Verifies exact 38 stage markers before any actual PNG validation. Only four fixed case×phase boolean labels, exact count and NOT-tested provenance printed, never original captures, pixels, screen coordinates, paths or log. No Git publishing.
- New FAKE-ONLY contract `scripts/test-aqua-private-dynamic-paint-pilot-contract.py` blob `517a4986e452bffc0115708cf0fb62f4424c69dc` commit `561618737fba4a37c5c4849228562adc404166c1`: exact source pin, two Qt canvas-only windows, original authored state transitions, stage/cleanup/resource invariants; synthesized 32 RGBA PNGs covering directional one-phase exterior classification and corruption, incomplete and insecure files, forged frame metadata and missing motion/phase witness. It does NOT run Qt. New model, QML fixture, runner and synthetic test are SOURCE-STAGED only; neither fake contract nor actual Qt dynamic pilot has yet run owner-local.
- Full scope described in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `199c3d85b4bde8f2e85d6b01aca47c6044cd0b86`. NEXT SINGLE OWNER ACTION: fresh clean owner-mode0700 private ephemeral `dev` clone with exact reviewed four NEW blobs, original fake alpha test/PNG decoder, reviewed original production QML/mask and borrowed Qt guard pins. Run `test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py` and new `test-aqua-private-dynamic-paint-pilot-contract.py` FAKE-ONLY first. Only if BOTH PASS, acknowledge/run `aqua-manual-private-dynamic-paint-pilot.py --acknowledge-private-actual-dynamic-composite-pilot` ONCE in that clone. On error stop and report fixed GATE without logs/screenshot. A dynamic full-composite YES does NOT prove original ShapePath painted outside or actual Wayland clip/pointer reach. The next separate task after qualified pilot is reviewed moving original-Bézier-only matched-scene methodology and eventually 4edge×3scale×2phase painter coverage; real compositor clip/input, native replay, popups and canonical validation remain open. NEVER change production mask/full-host Region/default-off Aqua/Rust/`stable` as a shortcut.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 dynamic painted Qt pilot INCONCLUSIVE; fixed-token diagnosis staged

- OWNER LOCAL at exact `SOURCE_SHA=8ec15920c9a0c2b952ea6116e8bcc2fb81bf6540` reported `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS` and `AQUA_PRIVATE_DYNAMIC_COMPOSITE_PILOT_INERT_PASS`, then actual Qt pilot `GATE=PRIVATE_QT_STAGE_OR_MOTION_INCONCLUSIVE`. The fixed gate occurs AFTER owned isolated child cleanup/code0/private log safety + allowlisted parsing but BEFORE successful exact 38-stage actual transition/motion check and BEFORE ANY of 32 private PNG classifications. DO NOT claim actual moving painted-alpha proof. Prior real twelve-case STATIC original-QML full/core 4edge×3scale evidence remains accepted and unchanged. Old private log is gone because prior owner one-command auto-cleaned; reason unknown without new evidence.

Never run Qt itself or open/copy any PNG; no arbitrary Qt logs, host metadata, coordinates or private paths printed; categories may be fixture fail vs prefix-incomplete but NEVER classify as a new PASS. `scripts/test-aqua-private-dynamic-pilot-diagnostic-contract.py` blob `b8ccbf7860d1d2289f5c9d4b84a2ee531666dda5`, commit `ec73dc60a516654faf6540ef85378672bac02de5`: NEW fake-only source-pin, successful bounded parser and negative unknown/duplicate/out-of-order/injected markers plus read-only checks. These new files staged only; NO new owner-local tests or Qt diagnosis yet.
- Full evidence/scope in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `16a38cd2385bde2f345de7c1e5a1029d81311bea`. NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: use fresh current `dev` clone with exact reviewed diagnostic/test/old runner/fixture/PNG model/core runner/QML production/mask blob pins, first run old alpha and old pilot synthetic + NEW diagnostic synthetic tests to exact PASS, then one acknowledged original Qt dynamic pilot. If original returns a qualified PASS, report that categorical result; if EXACT `PRIVATE_QT_STAGE_OR_MOTION_INCONCLUSIVE`, run the new diagnostic in SAME clone before cleanup, report fixed QML failure or missing stage count/category, stop (no additional Qt run). For all other failures return original bounded GATE and STOP; fix forward only after reviewing the diagnostic, preserving production input mask/full-host Region/default-off Aqua/native backend/`stable`.

## Checkpoint — 2026-10-02 stretch stage 19 failure localized; independent early-motion observer source staged

- OWNER exact current `dev` source `91c36628c08b44435591774f28e495290d1726d8` reported old PNG synthetic, old 32-image dynamic synthetic and new read-only diagnostic synthetic PASS. ONE actual private original-QML dynamic pilot then failed `GATE=PRIVATE_QT_STAGE_OR_MOTION_INCONCLUSIVE`. Read-only category-only same-run diagnosis, before private log deletion: `OBSERVED_STAGE_COUNT=19`, `LAST_REVIEWED_STAGE=STRETCH_7_BOTTOM`, `KNOWN_QML_FAILURE=SAMPLED_MAPPED_MOTION_NOT_OBSERVED`, `GATE=PRIVATE_DYNAMIC_QML_FAILURE_IDENTIFIED`. This accounts for three setup + ALL 16 successful stretch PNG-save markers; at least one of TOP/BOTTOM failed the old mapped geometry movement witness between actual PNG starts (350ms plus asynchronous capture time). It does NOT say which case, does NOT classify those PNGs as outside-host and did not start release. The earlier static real 12-case full/core painted-alpha matrix results remain the ONLY qualified painted evidence. Root cause may be missed early spring interval OR actual animation problem; no forced pass.
- Exact unchanged original `WaterDropletBody.qml` reviewed: `Behavior on stateStretch { enabled: root.motionEnabled; SpringAnimation { spring: 2.8; damping: 0.36 } }`, and independent bob/sway when active.

Separately sample BOTH actual stateStretch transitions and mapped original body corners every 40ms BEFORE the first delayed PNG and throughout both stretch/release. Require >=4 independent samples, real >0.1 original spring state delta, actual intermediate original spring state, >0.12 mapped corner displacement and real phase target reach per case and phase. Fail closed with 16 different `MOTION_TOP|BOTTOM_STRETCH|RELEASE_*` known labels identifying exact witness deficiency, not by weakening a threshold.

TOP×1 sampled STRETCH=YES exterior painted alpha, RELEASE=NO observed; BOTTOM×1.5 sampled STRETCH=YES, RELEASE=YES. Eight actual painted PNGs per original spring phase/case, both actual stateStretch and mapped original body motion independently observed at 40ms; NO is only an eight-frame non-observation, not a global limit. The full original composite scene cannot by itself attribute painted alpha to original core vs cradle/internal detail; actual compositor clipping and pointer input not tested.

Hide all four OTHER body visuals and external cradle only on these PRIVATE instances BEFORE original spring movement, verify original core-alone visibility throughout independent 40ms original stateStretch+mapped-body observer and 8 actual captures per real stretch/release phase/case, retain strict per-case/per-phase 40ms spring, intermediate-state, mapped displacement and target-reaching acceptance and fail on any topology/drift. 32 expected original-core painted PNGs, no production/QML edits.
- New `scripts/aqua-manual-private-dynamic-core.py` FINAL blob `50e351a3ec2775f02d92d76e63d09727e008cf71`, correction commit `a735d0b8aed71b0951feceea813645e8f80b7913`: previous reviewed 0700 owner-only fresh clean source-pinned current `dev`, isolated private XDG/D-Bus offscreen Quickshell v0.3.1, own 48s process group cleanup, 8MiB per-child-file cap, private 256KiB log, exactly 32 private 0600 PNG each <=1MiB, full retained previous original production/PNG parser pins. Requires exactly 39 stage labels including early `CORE_ISOLATION_VERIFIED` then real independent per-case/per-phase movement+all 32 actual original-core alpha classifications. Prints four categorical core-only phase outputs, explicit `FULL_SCENE_PIXEL_MATCH=NOT_TESTED` and known strict failure categories only; never raw private PNG/log/path/coordinates, no publication. New fake-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-dynamic-core-contract.py` blob `388112cab3aef026795ba40de0d6990cc4d32257`, commit `1896f6e786fb0e907cb2c5401a2fdb3c6497dc4d`, checks original core/cradle isolation, 40ms spring+mapped witnesses, stage tokens and synthetic 32 PNG cases including corrupted/truncated/permission/witness/forged-frame negatives. NEW files SOURCE STAGED; neither new fake contract nor actual core-moving Qt pilot has yet run owner-local.
- Research scope/evidence updated `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `987ffe92f087ca2bdb4af9ad87f85171b96c3343`. NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: one fresh trusted owner-mode0700 clean current `dev` clone exact-pinned new 4 blobs and original reviewed production QML/mask/PNG parser and trusted guard; run old `test-aqua-private-painted-alpha-model.py` and NEW `test-aqua-private-dynamic-core-contract.py` FAKE-ONLY first. Only on exact dual PASS, run ONE `aqua-manual-private-dynamic-core.py --acknowledge-private-actual-dynamic-composite-pilot`; return only strict four source-original moving core phase outcomes or one fixed categorical failure+last verified stage; stop on failure, do not fallback to cross-run pixel overlap claims. Later gates remain: same-frame source-specific comparison without interrupting real spring, dynamic all-edge/scale coverage, actual compositor clipping/hover/click, real native backend replay, popup interference/multioutput/fractional/hotplug and canonical validation. NEVER edit production full-host input Region, default-off Aqua, original QML/Rust or `stable` as substitute.

## Checkpoint — moving-core inert failure: stale private env test string fixed forward

- OWNER first attempt at the newly source-staged moving ORIGINAL Bézier/stroke-only Qt canary returned **`GATE=DYNAMIC_CORE_INERT_FAILED`** before any `DEV_HEAD`, Qt launch, actual core-only PNG or dynamic moving core results. This is NOT a production or Qt acceptance failure and must not be conflated with the earlier real FULL composite 32-frame dynamic PASS on `2717ce9a683aa1eca69db4720454f1bdb343384a`; full-composite TOP×1 stretch YES/release NO observed, BOTTOM×1.5 both phases YES and the earlier 12-case frozen source-core comparison remain qualified independently.
- SOURCE REVIEW localized stale copy-derived string assertion in fake-only `scripts/test-aqua-private-dynamic-core-contract.py` original blob `388112cab3aef026795ba40de0d6990cc4d32257`: it expected OLD `env["AQUA_DYNAMIC_PILOT_DIR"]` while the new core-only runner AND private fixture intentionally use `AQUA_DYNAMIC_CORE_DIR`. Updated ONLY this wrong inert assertion, with no relaxing real isolation/spring/mapped-pose/PNG/security acceptance. New exact fake-only Git blob `6d141b02aecd1929ae9c197dffaa1112aff87b06`, commit `74399693ed87a4a3f03f328fd0aaeb696fc63601`. Source review of the derived fake test's remaining fixture and runner string assertions matches source and unchanged exact blob pins, but a new owner-local fake PASS has NOT occurred since the correction. Existing moving core model `ec4ba1af10cabbb1f645ea94af7f5fca0ac5e731`, fixture `d10da7216afef1ba579775a87505b2d649e4fe65` and guarded runner `50e351a3ec2775f02d92d76e63d09727e008cf71` unchanged; production original QML, mask, default-off Aqua, backend and `stable` untouched.
- Detailed checkpoint `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `f3584b9f62cb78970c220d462b2ee8151b9ab2c9`. NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: a NEW clean source-pinned mode0700 current-`dev` private ephemeral clone; run previous original alpha fake and corrected fake-only moving-core contract FIRST. Only on BOTH exact PASS markers, execute ONE consented original-core-only active original spring 32-PNG Qt canary. If synthetic gate fails again, return ONLY that fixed category plus optionally the safe FAKE test's failed source line number (not raw logs), do not launch Qt or silently weaken thresholds. On owner actual moving core qualification, return only four categorical phase/case source-original core exterior observations; never claim cross-run same-frame pixel overlap or compositor input acceptance.

## Checkpoint — original moving core-only Qt PASS; BOTTOM frozen paint-source partition staged

- OWNER actual clean `dev` `SOURCE_SHA=1d7778b16863ac0bde433e23f08e36ac099f8f36`: original bounded alpha `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`, corrected source-core `AQUA_PRIVATE_DYNAMIC_CORE_INERT_PASS`, actual private ORIGINAL Bézier ShapePath/stroke-only Qt spring `QT_DYNAMIC_CORE_FRAMES=32`, per-case/per-phase independent original real Qt spring+mapped-body motion observation at 40ms, private original source visibility (four other body visuals AND external cradle hidden), `GATE=PRIVATE_DYNAMIC_CORE_PILOT_CLASSIFIED`. CORE exterior: TOP×1 stretch YES/release NO observed, BOTTOM×1.5 both stretch and release NO observed. Previous independently owner-PASS full original companion real spring 32-frame campaign at `SOURCE_SHA=2717ce9a683aa1eca69db4720454f1bdb343384a`: full TOP×1 stretch YES/release NO observed; full BOTTOM×1.5 both phases YES. NO means only absence in EIGHT sampled images per case/phase, NEVER full moving/extrema proof. The two actual dynamic runs were separate Qt instances at independent times with intentionally different private sibling/cradle visibility, NOT synchronized same-pixel comparisons. Previous same-session same-pose static BOTTOM×1.5 F1C0O0 proves original full composite but not original core painted outside in that fixed state, still NOT identifiable culprit by itself.
- NEXT narrow staged source task: original BOTTOM×1.5 FROZEN same-pose source group partition (FULL, original core, four internal body non-core DETAILS grouped, original external CRADLE) in exact ONE original owner-private `AbyssCompanion` and ONE Qt session. The images are SEQUENTIAL private scene visibility states at mapped pose strict .05, not simultaneous production renders. NEW pure alpha model `scripts/aqua-private-bottom-static-source-model.py` Git blob `3eb60d0b7222c12f6d07a772f3bbf94e0cadb3f3` commit `cf87a56790dd4fea47ca2ebc99aefdf1472933d9`: original pinned bounded RGBAlpha8 alpha parser, 2px canvas privacy border, exact four 320×300 PNGs, fixed BOTTOM×1.5 centered host rectangle, minimum interior paint only for FULL and original Bézier CORE; DETAILS/CRADLE correctly permit genuine full transparency. Four bool source-isolated exterior alpha + independent 3 booleans for same exterior-pixel spatial overlap with FULL. This static within-pose overlap is NOT proof of full-composite pixel causality, anti-alias/occlusion or instantaneous dynamic matched frames.
- New original-QML-only private fixture `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-bottom-source/shell.qml` blob `3838ac82c70263324fa50185d75a60478363f7c1` commit `f1c2b31a25c5d47d085b4a13b1df291bb9f60a0b`: one source-original unchanged component and exact source two direct children (BODY + external CRADLE), original body five children + unique 76×92 original core, original 180° BOTTOM rotation/scale, mapped 24-finite coordinate pose and exact fixed state check across all four captures; restore FULL visibility at end and abort on source/pose/drift/save issues. Never touches source production QML, live screen, Niri, pointer/hit region, native backend or `stable`.
- New bounded owner-only `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-source.py` blob `5130e0dcf14e987291f828fc4ce6baaf8429af2f` commit `7962444f7fe9e42343293f32f7ee581fd7516f41`: recursively reuse earlier owner-PASS source review/private fresh current-`dev` 0700 clone, original production QML/style/config/PNG parser, isolated Quickshell0.3.1 offscreen private XDG+D-Bus, exactly one owned 34s Qt group with kill/reap and child file cap8MiB/private log<=256KiB, exact 11 fixed source stage markers, four 0600 <=1MiB capture files and exact strict model. Publishes only fixed categorical exterior/overlap values or fixed QML+stage failure/error GATE; no raw private PNG/log/path/coordinates, no Git publication.
- New `scripts/test-aqua-private-bottom-static-source-contract.py` blob `a8822ac52b8c92d14c34176ff462e90808a1cd5a` commit `c10a9bfac83ef991aaa0d1327f1bbd077eefe84c`: FAKE-ONLY original source/topology/map/visibility/resource/stage safety assertions, 4 synthetic RGBA8s for cradle-vs-DETAILS exterior/overlap/non-overlap, transparent isolated noncore, malformed/missing/extra/unsafe image negatives, no real Qt or desktop. These FOUR new files are SOURCE STAGED and internal string/source pin reviewed, NOT YET owner inert-executed or owner actual Qt executed. Detailed checkpoint at `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `c70cc0ff20c2299f5fb95c67bd64ed7d3633b443`.
- NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: use ONE fresh trusted mode0700 clean source-pinned current-`dev` private disposable clone, run prior bounded alpha fake and NEW bottom isolation fake; only on both exact markers run ONE explicit `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-source.py --acknowledge-private-bottom-original-source`, return four source-isolated bools + three FULL exterior same-position overlaps or safe fixed failure. On synthetic or Qt failure STOP and fix forward; do not relax original scene/mask/motion/privacy requirements or turn sampled noncore isolation into exact production causality. If internal DETAILS are positive, next split original individual details; if CRADLE alone is positive, review its exact QML paint bounds; else if only full original is positive investigate compositing/antialias interactions without assuming subtraction. Future gates remain live Wayland visual clipping/input, native Rust replay, popup, multioutput/fractional and canonical maintainer validation.

## Checkpoint — owner actual BOTTOM cradle static exterior+overlap PASS; private original cradle inset candidate staged

- OWNER ACTUAL private Qt `SOURCE_SHA=bfd8f82c56ed33567ed17eb7e95013a7860d0402`: prior RGBA8 and NEW bottom layer fake-only contracts both PASS, then ONE actual ORIGINAL BOTTOM×1.5 static same-instance/same-fixed-source-pose four-frame full/core/details/cradle group-isolation Qt test `GATE=PRIVATE_BOTTOM_STATIC_SOURCE_CLASSIFIED`. Actual sampled `FULL_EXTERIOR=YES`, `CORE_EXTERIOR=NO`, `DETAILS_EXTERIOR=NO`, `CRADLE_EXTERIOR=YES`; exact same-coordinate original FULL exterior pixel overlap: CORE NO, DETAILS NO, CRADLE YES. The ORIGINAL bottom-anchored external cradle is therefore a concrete static source of exterior-alpha pixels spatially overlapping sampled original FULL exterior. Strictly not formal full pixel causality due sequential altered visibility and compositing, nor global animated frames or live compositor clip/input. Previous independently owner-PASSED full+core actual animated 32-frame campaigns and previous corrected static 12-case matrix remain separately accepted, not merged into simultaneous dynamic proof.
- Original source `AbyssCompanion.qml` remains blob `b5b01835a282458eba0d0268396ae2c350d919d2`; original cradle anchors bottom host with width58,height10 on BOTTOM, `scale=1+root.ripple*.16`. In reviewed private baseline `ripple=pulse=0`, its source geometry stays host-anchored even as the body spring animates. NEXT source-staged HIGH VALUE private inward margin candidate, **not production fix**: FOUR original FULL-companion sequential actual offscreen captures at BOTTOM×1.5 on ONE unchanged-source original original-instance, same frozen body pose and exact host center scaling, root stateStretch1, cradle original margin0 as strict original exterior-positive baseline then ORIGINAL cradle private `anchors.bottomMargin=1,2,3` logical QML px trials. Every trial verifies original 24-number mapped body+host pose, original body five visible source components+external cradle and exact source-mapped cradle rectangle; restores original cradle margin0 and verifies before finish. No source QML, production mask, default Aqua, native Rust, compositor or `stable` mutation.
- Four new files SOURCE STAGED ONLY, not owner fake-tested or Qt executed: `scripts/aqua-private-bottom-cradle-inset-model.py` blob `77c89bd49771992b2618ba656768840592aaa594` commit `646ec1fbfc841ec98257fc2a9761ea4c4e30fdf5` original bounded RGBA8 classifier, baseline must reproduce exterior YES or explicit UNQUALIFIED, returns fixed per-trial boolean and smallest among TESTED 1/2/3 or NONE (NOT absolute minimum); `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-bottom-inset/shell.qml` blob `45fc03e743d08a996c763c491e0d2b42d22f75ba` commit `04d971901612ff71870f37b91de33c72533e7ab1` original full private component at exact same frozen pose each trial, only private original cradle margin altered, original margin restored; `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-inset.py` blob `75f923b104c8409b3532a809c3ba62cfd5998e03` commit `0716db5c6fa131c26752dbf8630d2980479cecad` source recursively pins previously actual-owner-PASSED `aqua-manual-private-bottom-source.py`, original production QML, alpha parser, trusted current clean mode0700 owner-only `dev` clone and private Quickshell v0.3.1 offscreen XDG/D-Bus; one 34s owned private Qt group with kill/reap, per-file 8MiB child cap, <=256KiB private log, EXACT 11 fixed stages and exactly four mode0600 PNGs each <=1MiB and source immutability. Prints strict known categorical outcome only. `scripts/test-aqua-private-bottom-inset-contract.py` blob `83df8635e1cede5040f0c2ec520a76ea5588af4c` commit `7c8031989b02e653e172b9d22288f1676e7e05b9` fake-only source/QML/private guard, 4-panel synthetic alpha minimum tested, all-positive none, baseline nonreproduction, corrupt/untrusted/extra/missing/unsafe PNG and malformed stage rejection. Internal STATIC spelling/blobs reviewed, NO claim new inert PASS until owner locally runs.
- Full scoped evidence/design `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `df01aec730e90169345b879419839d316f09469c`. NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: fresh one owner-owned mode0700 clean exact-sources-pinned `dev` ephemeral clone. FIRST run old alpha fake and NEW inset fake-only test to exact PASS, then ONE explicit `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-inset.py --acknowledge-private-bottom-cradle-inset` private original-component offscreen BOTTOM1.5 experiment. On any fake/Qt failure stop and report fixed GATE and optional FAKE-only local source failing assertion line, not raw Qt private logs. On PASS return sampled original full baseline + trial1/2/3 exterior flags and only smallest TESTED successful margin. Do NOT patch original source now or claim visual panel connection, all-edge dynamic or actual Wayland compositor pointer/clipping until later separate reviewed gates.

## Checkpoint — owner static bottom cradle margin1 candidate PASS; same-process moving margin0 versus margin1 source staged

- OWNER actual local fresh `dev` SHA `8fb4d2ebb7453030562b6906621c594cbfdaa330`: owner-qualified previous RGBA8 fake and new strict inset fake both PASS, then ONE real Qt0.3.1 private offscreen **original FULL BOTTOM×1.5** same-one-instance/same-frozen-body-pose four-frame ORIGINAL cradle bottomMargin0/1/2/3 experiment `GATE=PRIVATE_BOTTOM_INSET_CANDIDATE_CLASSIFIED`. `BASELINE_M0_OUTSIDE_HOST=YES`, `M1_OUTSIDE_HOST=NO`, `M2_OUTSIDE_HOST=NO`, `M3_OUTSIDE_HOST=NO`, `SMALLEST_TESTED_NO_EXTERIOR_MARGIN=1`, production unchanged. Candidate 1 original-host logical QML pixel in this frozen fixture, only minimum AMONG TESTED values; not moving proof, global/fractional minimum, visual screen-edge/panel styling or compositor input acceptance. Earlier owner actual static source partition at BOTTOM×1.5 localized full exterior alpha and a coincident exterior pixel in external source original CRADLE but not original Bézier core or four grouped internal body details. Two independently executed owner-verified 32-frame moving FULL and CORE-only spring campaigns remain separate, not pixel-synchronized dynamic causality.
- NEXT narrowly scoped TWO ORIGINAL FULL BOTTOM×1.5 companions in ONE private Qt process: baseline original cradle margin0 vs SAME original source privately inset cradle margin1, both actual authored spring stretch+release, independently observed original stateStretch/intermediate/mapped body displacement every 40ms per cohort/phase, strict source two-children/five fully-visible body visuals and actual source-mapped original cradle 0/1 margin geometry verified on every observer tick and each PNG. Eight sequential original FULL frames for each of two cohorts x two phases = EXACT 32 owner-only captures. Crucial NEW qualification: the current same-process ORIGINAL margin0 control MUST actually paint exterior alpha in BOTH sampled spring phases. If either baseline phase fails, report only a fail-closed `GATE=MOVING_BASELINE_NOT_REPRODUCED`; never grant margin1 a dynamic success from a failed/missed baseline. Margin1 NO can only mean non-observation in eight actual sampled images/phase; two independent windows are sequential grabs, NOT instantaneous per-pixel pairs or maximum spring envelope.
- FOUR new files now SOURCE STAGED ONLY (original component QML/mask/default-off/Rust/`stable` untouched): pure `scripts/aqua-private-dynamic-bottom-inset-model.py` blob `834dc0e861bf2b06821a3f4399833201841e7d0e` commit `880b2b18ef50c5d046200a7e0f3eff355b6b6811`; privately owned original-QML source `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-moving-bottom-inset/shell.qml` blob `26133a295433f7f61ce64f94a2ece3d14015a57b` commit `71ec11039d8a4888539a8790a1397ab9489009c1`; guarded source-pinned owner-only `scripts/aqua-manual-private-moving-bottom-inset.py` FINAL blob `d58e8c4720573de94e0992f35d3a2b6e4dd65a7e` fixed-category baseline-failure commit `c58b11ef189133d2267ad8a03c5d137f865092fb`; fake-only source-pin/malformed PNG/baseline omitted/safety/stage tester `scripts/test-aqua-private-moving-bottom-inset-contract.py` FINAL blob `3d49bae020ff9f860ae7189a974045167ece74aa` pin refresh commit `d21aa0d1445572111dd7e21d41dd8f67014af805`. Guard recursively reuses prior actually owner-PASS exact original QML and clean owner-mode0700 current-remote `dev`, Quickshell0.3.1 offscreen private XDG+D-Bus, one bounded 48s owned child group with full cleanup, max8MiB per file, <=256KiB private owner-only log, 32 exactly named owner0600 PNGs <=1MiB each, exact 39 fixed stage markers, postrun source immutability; prints only four phase/case categorical results or fixed failure category. All NEW fake and actual Qt results remain UNTESTED until owner local execution. Detailed specification checkpoint `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `f34308fb66ed146a2cbe586ce0ecaf786401c74c`.
- NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: one fresh source-pinned clean current `dev` owner-owned mode0700 shallow disposable clone, old RGBA8 fake then NEW moving-bottom-inset fake test; only if both exact PASS, ONE consented `scripts/aqua-manual-private-moving-bottom-inset.py --acknowledge-private-moving-bottom-cradle-inset` private owned offscreen original full margin0/margin1 spring pilot. Return source SHA, four boolean sampled phase outcomes, static limitations and fixed gate; if baseline fails stop, no local retries/screenshots/private logs/pixels posted. Even if m1 NO in both phases with m0 YES, before production change still need screen-edge/panel connection evidence, all-edge/scale dynamic coverage, actual live Wayland compositor clipping and nested pointer/input behavior and native replay. No production full-host Region shrink/default-on Aqua and no `stable` edits.

## Checkpoint — moving margin A/B first owner fake failed pre-Qt; strict ordered stage parser repaired

- OWNER FIRST original FULL BOTTOM×1.5 margin0/1 real-spring A/B **local preflight STOP** at `DEV_HEAD=890f998bebd00ba7afae39dd55c98a1b53d6d79b`: old owner-PASS bounded alpha `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`, NEW moving-inset fake returns `INERT_TEST_LINE=132` inside `denied`, `INERT_FAILURE_TYPE=ASSERTION`, `GATE=MOVING_INSET_INERT_FAILED`. No Qt launched, zero owner real moving-margin images; do not mark dynamic margin1 acceptance, nor invalidate owner-verified static four-margin actual QT result margin0 exterior YES / margin1/2/3 NO (`8fb4d2ebb7453030562b6906621c594cbfdaa330`).
- SOURCE DIAGNOSIS: first NEW derived moving runner copied an older fixed-enum stage parser that checked token member+nonduplicate but not EXACT ordered-prefix position; forged `AQUA_MOVING_INSET_STAGE=RELEASE_START` alone could be accepted. The new fake-only contract's negative tests correctly caught this real evidence-integrity weakness. Tightened ONLY NEW `scripts/aqua-manual-private-moving-bottom-inset.py` Git blob `9a4e75b444720b2cee4b0c9629db5c59d50dada0` commit `81adec4bd555e3f0d6e53495697b4aa2b9643bad`: every stage must equal next expected 39-token ordered stage, no skipped/out-of-order frames and no stage after any allowlisted QML failure; old trusted runner and original production QML/style/mask unchanged. Exact-pinned NEW fake contract `scripts/test-aqua-private-moving-bottom-inset-contract.py` blob `e9311f2998b584613386b2e37e7b9175a02ca9a7`, commit `caca3112e22dfafc72372d55312ee91521bb6ad5`: retains original synthetic strict 32-PNG and margin0 BOTH-PHASE positive witness baseline, adds missing intermediate token/post-failure marker rejection checks. Pure model `834dc0e861bf2b06821a3f4399833201841e7d0e`, original two-BOTTOM source fixture `26133a295433f7f61ce64f94a2ece3d14015a57b` unmodified. REVIEWED source string guards and all source pins agree; the corrected fake-only and actual moving Qt have NOT yet been owner rerun or accepted.
- Source detailed design checkpoint `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `b40a51e18c89852df5612e5e385412bbda9c3770`. NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: fresh owner-owned mode0700 clean current-`dev` pinned ephemeral private clone: old bounded RGBAlpha8 fake and updated moving-bottom-inset fake **FIRST**; only if BOTH exact PASS perform ONE explicitly authorized original BOTTOM×1.5 original full-composite margin0 positive control vs PRIVATE cradle margin1, 8 real original full PNGs per cohort per spring phase (32 total), both independent real 40ms stateStretch/intermediate and mapped pose and exact original 0/1 cradle geometry, original positive margin0 in BOTH phases mandatory. On any failure print fixed GATE, possibly safe synthetic failing line and fixed category; no raw Qt logs/PNG/screenshots/coordinates. No original QML/Region/default-off/native-Rust/`stable` changes.

## Checkpoint — owner actual 32-frame BOTTOM dynamic margin0/1 PASS; pending visual edge-band assessment

- OWNER ACTUAL clean `dev SOURCE_SHA=152a82995875aaa29d6445b10cacfeb406fecfc4` passed the old bounded original RGBA8 fake `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS` and repaired strict fake `AQUA_PRIVATE_MOVING_BOTTOM_INSET_INERT_PASS` before one explicitly authorized real Qt0.3.1 private moving bottom A/B. Verified `QT_DYNAMIC_INSET_FRAMES=32`, `INDEPENDENT_40MS_QT_MOTION_WITNESSES=YES`, two original BOTTOM×1.5 full-companion source-pinned private offscreen instances with ORIGINAL cradle margin0 strict positive control and original cradle PRIVATE margin1 candidate in ONE Qt process, independently witnessed real spring+mapped motion in stretch and release for BOTH. Mandatory same-session margin0 control positive exterior alpha BOTH phases: `M0_150_STRETCH_OUTSIDE_HOST=YES`, `M0_150_RELEASE_OUTSIDE_HOST=YES`; privately inset candidate `M1_150_STRETCH_OUTSIDE_HOST=NO`, `M1_150_RELEASE_OUTSIDE_HOST=NO`; `GATE=PRIVATE_MOVING_INSET_CANDIDATE_CLASSIFIED`; `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`. These are eight actually sampled original full-composite PNGs per cohort/phase, 32 in all; two private render windows sampled SEQUENTIALLY, never synchronous pixel-overlap proof. NO means absence at sampled timestamps only, not every spring phase or other scales.
- Previous owner actual SAME-INSTANCE ORIGINAL FULL BOTTOM×1.5 frozen PRIVATE cradle bottomMargin0/1/2/3 observed original margin0 exterior YES and margins1/2/3 exterior NO, smallest AMONG tested=1 host logical px, with all five original body visuals visible. Previous SAME-pose source partition observed full exterior YES, original CORE NO, original internal DETAILS NO, external original CRADLE YES sharing original full exterior pixel locations. Dynamic A/B and frozen geometry together qualify margin1 as a narrowly scoped PRIVATE bottom paint-boundary candidate, NOT a production fix.
- NEXT unresolved product constraint is **VISUAL CONNECTIVITY** to the screen edge/panel: the original CRADLE is anchored `bottom: parent.bottom`; shifting only its `bottomMargin` by 1 original host logical px might create a visible seam at BOTTOM×1.5 while eliminating exterior alpha. Do not silently trade painted bounds for an ugly disconnected Aqua. First assess original full-composite sampled edge-adjacent alpha continuity using exact already owner-qualified ORIGINAL four-margin frozen capture fixture in a NEW private source-pinned categorical band analyzer, WITHOUT changing original QML, input Region or touching the host desktop. A pixel near the mathematical private host boundary is only a **PRIVATE SIMULATED-PANEL EDGE-BAND** observation, not proof of actual panel styling, desktop compositor alpha blending, or user-visible screen-edge connectivity. If private band shows a gap or uncertainty, do NOT promote candidate to production; obtain separately reviewed targeted live compositor visual+real pointer evidence using actual user interaction, preserving current Aqua default disabled and full-host input mask until safe acceptance.

## Checkpoint — original BOTTOM dynamic margin1 two-spring private QT owner PASS; virtual panel-edge band source staged

- OWNER-LOCAL qualified actual clean `dev SOURCE_SHA=152a82995875aaa29d6445b10cacfeb406fecfc4`: repaired strict moving margin0/1 fake PASS and previous alpha fake PASS, then ONE actual owner-only Quickshell0.3.1 offscreen original FULL BOTTOM×1.5 two-instance/one-process PRIVATE cradle-anchor margin0 original positive control vs margin1 private candidate dynamic A/B, `QT_DYNAMIC_INSET_FRAMES=32`, independent 40ms original spring-state/intermediate/mapped-body motion witnesses for BOTH original component cohorts across BOTH active stretch and release. SAME actual private Qt session M0 mandatory control exterior alpha stretch YES/release YES; M1 candidate exterior alpha stretch NO/release NO sampled across 8 original full RGBA8 captures/cohort/phase. `GATE=PRIVATE_MOVING_INSET_CANDIDATE_CLASSIFIED`, no same-instant pixel comparison, `COMPOSITOR_AND_POINTER=UNTESTED`, `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`. Earlier owner-qualified EXACT original full same-instance frozen BOTTOM margin0/1/2/3 4-image run: original M0 exterior YES, private M1/M2/M3 exterior NO; smallest AMONG trial = 1 original logical Qt pixel. Strong PRIVATE candidate progress only; no global dynamic/max extrema, all other edge/scale qualification, live desktop/Wayland visual/pointer or panel connection proof.
- PRODUCT VISUAL RISK: source original cradle remains bottom-anchored, so shifting its bottom margin 1 logical Qt px may create an actual visible seam between Aqua and a bar/panel even while removing exterior alpha. Per original product priority existing popup and companion art should remain visibly connected to bar/screen edge. Do not trade off contact without separately reviewed acceptance. A NEW STATIC *virtual mathematical panel-boundary* band classifier has been SOURCE-STAGED while reusing existing owner-PASSED actual original full BOTTOM margin0/1/2/3 Qt source fixture and owner-private Qt runner UNCHANGED; this is a conservative preliminary seam signal, not real desktop test.
- New pure `scripts/aqua-private-bottom-edge-band-model.py` Git blob `dbfb226a4fa5f53154df25a6bd69d90674372a0f`, commit `ba77ee9e529229ccd8d4aa21df439ac3e54cdf2f`: exact private original host BOTTOM scale1.5 center rect, trusted bounded threshold24 RGBA8 alpha decoder/privacy 2px canvas crop reject, last original host-inside raster row y221 (host bottom222.5), inner supporting raster row y220, original cradle central x119..192, 3 contiguous same-x pixels with threshold alpha in BOTH rows as strictly synthetic boundary-contact signal. Exact FULL original M0 exterior-positive + M1 exterior-negative and M0 band-positive baseline MUST reproduce or FAIL. Reports four fixed boolean rows + M1 potential band-gap signal ONLY, NO exact cradle-only attribution, actual panel image/pointer, real compositor or visual aesthetics claims. A positive M1 contact does NOT qualify production visual continuity.
- New owner-only `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-edge-band.py` Git blob `a629324e7107882475dcf4cedbff208945c7eddf`, commit `fa001c233e82e6d59909cb8130eac8ada411a4f0`: recursively pins and calls UNCHANGED previous actual owner-PASSED `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-inset.py` blob `75f923b104c8409b3532a809c3ba62cfd5998e03`, exactly one real offscreen original private four-margin 4×320×300 RGBA8 capture on ONE original unchanged-source original full component at ONE frozen pose, single owned 34s private child group and existing exact stage/sandbox/version/cleanup/capture/source revalidation. Securely reuses 4 original 0600 PNGs from same fresh private owner 0700 clone, adds only pure edge band classifier, publishes categorical flags+fixed safe gate. New independent FAKE ONLY `scripts/test-aqua-private-bottom-edge-band-contract.py` Git blob `a52e3de94240e1daee89fc2835cb8b316267da34`, commit `d604f9a01e617b1ea75505007f7c162ee8310fb4`: source/QML/guard pins and synthetically generated bounded RGBA8 four-margin row/contact/tolerance classifications, missing baseline/missing candidate/malformed/unsafe/extra PNG rejections. New fake and real replay are SOURCE-STAGED and reviewed, NOT YET owner-executed. Detailed design checkpoint `docs/AQUA_NESTED_POINTER_ACCEPTANCE_DESIGN.md` commit `add709616cc1dcb471c4d1098a0d744bc559d39c`.
- NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: fresh exact-blob-pinned trusted mode0700 clean current-`dev` disposable clone. Prior original PNG fake and NEW edge-band fake first; ONLY if both exact PASS run ONE explicitly acknowledged reused original 4-frame Qt frozen margin source probe `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-edge-band.py --acknowledge-private-original-bottom-edge-band`. Return four categorical M0/M1/M2/M3 inner edge-band contact + M1 potential gap signal or fixed failure; no private screenshots/logs/pixels/coordinates/real desktop imagery, no file publication. Even after edge band signal, separately qualify real Wayland panel visual connection, real input, scaling/edges and animation extrema before source production edits; do not alter full-host Region, default-off Aqua, native Rust or `stable`.


## Checkpoint — OWNER-LOCAL static edge band reproduced; fractional BOTTOM private probe source staged (2026-10-02)

- Maintainer-supplied actual LOCAL terminal evidence at **SOURCE_SHA=74c016de533da681bfbf10b9c38a154a4aa7359a** (not a GitHub-published report): `AQUA_PRIVATE_PAINTED_ALPHA_INERT_PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_BOTTOM_EDGE_BAND_INERT_PASS`, `GATE=PRIVATE_BOTTOM_EDGE_BAND_CLASSIFIED`. One original FULL source-pinned BOTTOM×1.5 Qt instance at one frozen pose, FOUR 320×300 private RGBA8 frames: M0 EXTERIOR=YES, M1 EXTERIOR=NO; M0 inner two-row virtual boundary band=YES, M1/M2/M3 virtual band=NO; `M1_POTENTIAL_PIXEL_BAND_GAP_SIGNAL=YES`. This is an abstract PRIVATE raster criterion only: NO verified visible gap at actual desktop/panel, no real compositor input or pointer evidence. The earlier owner-qualified separate 32-frame margin0/margin1 moving run remains valid only for its own SHA and sampled both spring phases, and MUST NOT be incorrectly attributed to this static band run.
- Reviewed original `modules/abyss/companion/AbyssCompanion.qml` blob `b5b01835a282458eba0d0268396ae2c350d919d2`: original 58×10 rounded cradle directly anchored to host bottom, rotated original body separately centered. In original static BOTTOM×1.5 private fixture, host math bottom=222.5 on the 320×300 capture; original cradle mapped bottom for private logical inset `m` = `222.5 - 1.5*m`. Fractions .25/.5/.75 have distinct rasterized boundary placement and MAY separate exterior paint from virtual two-row contact. This remains a testable hypothesis, not a production choice.
- Staged NEW **source-only, NOT OWNER-EXECUTED** independent frozen same-instance fractional private pilot: original source-pinned untouched QML; private five-variant Qt fixture `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-bottom-fractional-band/shell.qml` Git blob `9203e9bf935c0a0ab995380dadf6a6ff27cc004d` changes ONLY original disposable cradle bottomMargin (0,.25,.5,.75,1). New pure `scripts/aqua-private-bottom-fractional-band-model.py` blob `f1c91fc2742b21a1cee9cb2911be7c614e8aeee5` measures BOTH thresholded original FULL painted exterior and abstract 2-row virtual band for EACH image; requires original M0 exterior/band positive and exact M1 exterior-negative same-session controls. New owner-only runner `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-fractional-band.py` blob `9c8e30eeef28d791966748bdc664e7ff204ccf67` recursively reuses previously qualified original static source/security guards, exact fixture/parser/model blob pins, Quickshell 0.3.1 offscreen private D-Bus, bounded one owned process, owner-only <=1MiB five images, strict ordered stage validation and immutable source post-check. New `scripts/test-aqua-private-bottom-fractional-band-contract.py` blob `d3f4a7c1dd1e5a230c012ab33fa8dbb79b9a67ce` provides FAKE ONLY strict synthetic positive/negative source/alpha/capture/stage/publish-contract checks. All are staged for local verification; no claim fake tests or real Qt have passed.
- This NEW runner can optionally publish only strict fixed-category JSON (NOT images, raw Qt logs, desktop details, pixel coordinates, source filenames beyond fixed whitelist) to `docs/aqua-private-reports/aqua-bottom-fractional-band-<source-sha>.json` through one **non-force fast-forward report-only commit to dev** after successful real classification, source+current remote equality and clean disposable clone. If push fails or authentication unavailable, runner prints `REPORT_PUBLISHED=NO`; maintainer need only provide the SHORT fixed categorical lines, never private log/PNG. Never mistake such owner-generated JSON for an independent GitHub replay of real Qt.
- NEXT ONE OWNER ACTION: after exact source-pin and a clean owner-owned disposable current-`dev` clone, run prior original bounded PNG fake regression + NEW fractional fake first, then **only if both pass**, one explicitly opted-in isolated original full frozen BOTTOM×1.5 five-frame local Qt run with optional sanitized report push. Re-read the new GitHub report on a later `tiếp tục`. If no fractional margin yields BOTH exterior=NO and virtual-band=YES, do not patch margin1 to production: investigate separate within-host connector/host-panel boundary placement instead. A positive private joint margin still requires separately qualified original real springs, all frames/extrema, real panel/edge visual connection, native compositor click/hover/popup, other edges/scales/fractional monitors, canonical exact SHA and maintainer aesthetic acceptance. Aqua remains DEFAULT OFF and original production full-host input Region remains unchanged; `stable` untouched.


## Checkpoint — owner-local first fractional FAKE PASS; pre-Qt clone-layout rejection and guard repair (2026-10-02)

- OWNER provided terminal output from clean current `dev SOURCE_SHA=f5c689cea67d8e8db036b6c364274b7a78d7f69a`: `SOURCE_PINS=PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_FRACTIONAL_BAND_INERT_PASS`, followed by `GATE=PRIVATE_FRACTIONAL_BAND_UNAVAILABLE`. This proves only the original NEW **fake-only** contract actually passed at that exact SHA. There is **NO demonstrated real fractional Qt capture** or fractional exterior/contact result, and no reported JSON publication. Never infer which fractions pass or a real visible seam.
- **Concrete source audit violation in preceding assistant-provided terminal command**: it cloned `aqua-fractional.*/Hadalis` whereas inherited unchanged immutable `scripts/aqua-manual-private-paint-core.py::audit_clone` requires `ROOT.name == "repo"`, parent name beginning `aqua-paint-canary.`, current cwd exact clone and private owner-only permissions. Thus the previous command CANNOT pass this inherited gate. Its raised earlier module exception was masked by a generic `PRIVATE_FRACTIONAL_BAND_UNAVAILABLE`; while this is a proven precondition failure, the generic observed output alone cannot prove whether any other failure also exists.
- Corrected NEW staged fractional runner `scripts/aqua-manual-private-bottom-fractional-band.py` blob `27620b5659ce7d0f3d4e0941dbc0633e053a8107`: an early same-policy `checked_clone_layout` fails closed with fixed `FRACTIONAL_CLONE_LAYOUT_INVALID` **before** invoking inherited audit/Qt, unchanged original shared `core["stage_files"]`, private pixel analyzer, motion/prod QML, or input Region. Source-only fake test updated blob `ed9edeb3b1c7eeb92b3850a45ec116546092ee30` with synthetic valid expected temp layout and invalid cwd/repo-name/parent-name/owner-only mode cases. **These new revised fake cases have not yet been executed by owner**.
- NEXT owner local action is **one** corrected source-pinned disposable `mktemp -d .../aqua-paint-canary.XXXXXXXX` owner-only 0700 directory with clone at `$WORK/repo`; verify exact preflight shape, clean current `dev` and NEW runner/test pins. Run ONLY NEW fake-only contract (previous original alpha fake and original static/dynamic real qualification already established, no needless rerun) and, if it passes, ONE explicitly authorized real Qt private original full frozen fractional A/B; optionally non-force publish fixed report-only JSON, never print private Qt logs/screenshots. If another gate fails, stop and return ONLY short categorical `GATE`; no repeated Qt retry or assumption of success. Aqua default OFF, production input mask and `stable` unchanged.


## Checkpoint — GitHub username prompt during fractional report publication (2026-10-02)

- OWNER reported the corrected owner-local one-command run appeared to hang at a GitHub username prompt. Exact stage and whether the 5 actual Qt frames succeeded were **not provided**; do NOT infer a real Qt PASS, do NOT claim source SHA of that local run or a published sanitized report solely from this observation.
- Reviewed the existing optional safe-report Git subprocess wrapper: its `call("push", "origin", "HEAD:refs/heads/dev")` inherited terminal stdin and any interactive Git credential helper, despite captured stdout/hidden stderr. Consequently HTTPS username/PAT prompting is a plausible cause, especially AFTER a successful private Qt classification. The original local command hides all runner stdout until completion; do NOT interpret apparent silence as Qt hang or a qualified result.
- New *source-staged* runner blob `da49d48850374c6f6da0db7ef11883959baebce1` explicitly disables Git authentication interactivity for **every optional report Git subprocess** (`stdin=DEVNULL`, `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, `GCM_INTERACTIVE=never`, `GIT_ASKPASS=/bin/false`, `SSH_ASKPASS=/bin/false`, `-c credential.interactive=never`); existing NONINTERACTIVE credential helpers may work. If credentials are unavailable/remote moved, optional push falls back to `REPORT_PUBLISHED=NO` after already printing only safe category rows, no login prompt or retry. NEW fake-only test blob `8c5243aeb513aec855e84d90721724b16deac4b8` pins updated runner and asserts no-prompt plumbing (SOURCE REVIEW only; owner has NOT executed the updated inert test).
- OWNER current run: press Ctrl+C ONCE at the prompt, preserve only fixed categorical terminal result if printed; do NOT share GitHub password/token or real private PNG/Qt logs. If prior run was interrupted earlier or has no safe classifications, a subsequent **separately initiated** single current-dev disposable test may be needed, with corrected `aqua-paint-canary.*/repo` clone layout and no-prompt environment, but do NOT silently auto-retry. No real fraction candidate yet accepted. Original Aqua default OFF, production Region and `stable` remain untouched.


## Checkpoint — owner-local fractional BOTTOM×1.5 static dual-signal result (2026-10-02)

- OWNER directly supplied a short categorical local run of the NEW source-pinned five-image frozen same-instance original full-component pilot at EXACT `SOURCE_SHA=0d7cdc50092a8269aa3fed34035dee71366324ef`: `SOURCE_PINS=PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_FRACTIONAL_BAND_INERT_PASS`, `AQUA_FRACTIONAL_PRIVATE_RGBA8_FRAMES=5`, `GATE=PRIVATE_FRACTIONAL_BAND_CLASSIFIED`, `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`. This was actual owner-local private Qt evidence **supplied in chat**, not independently re-executed or published as a GitHub report: `REPORT_PUBLISHED=NO` (noninteractive Git publishing did not complete).
- Exact owner-reported per-margin **SAME frozen full original Qt session** outcomes, threshold24 and abstract synthetic two-row inner-edge band: margin0 `EXTERIOR=YES,BAND=YES`; margin0.25 `EXTERIOR=NO,BAND=YES`; margin0.50 `EXTERIOR=NO,BAND=YES`; margin0.75 `EXTERIOR=NO,BAND=NO`; margin1 `EXTERIOR=NO,BAND=NO`. `JOINT_FRACTIONAL_CANDIDATE=YES` identifies **0.25 and 0.5 only among tested margins** as maintaining virtual edge-band signal while eliminating thresholded exterior in that single sampled static pose. This is owner-local evidence at source SHA only; it is NOT established full spring extrema, real panel connection, compositor clipping, hover/click or popup transfer.
- New narrow next gate: preserve original `modules/abyss/companion/AbyssCompanion.qml` and *reuse source-qualified original independent 40 ms spring/mapped-motion two-window BOTTOM×1.5 dynamic fixture*, substituting ONLY private candidate margin0.25 against same-session strict original margin0 positive exterior/contact control. For every sampled real Qt original full RGBA8 frame, evaluate BOTH exterior and virtual two-row inner band using identical bounded parser (rather than inferring dynamic contact from separate static). Require m0 exterior-positive in both phases and abstract m0 band-positive in each phase to qualify comparator; candidate positive acceptance must show zero thresholded exterior and positive abstract band in ALL separately sampled candidate frames in BOTH spring phases, with independent real motion witnesses for both cases in each phase. If candidate0.25 does not pass, test 0.5 as *separate future private fallback* only after reviewing 0.25 evidence; don't choose production based on static alone.
- Stage fail-closed fake-only synthetic raster/motion/safety contract and source pins BEFORE any owner local real dynamic request; strict current-`dev` clean `aqua-paint-canary.*/repo` clone, one bounded offscreen original Qt process, local raw files only, optional noninteractive publish strictly whitelisted categorical JSON if separately reviewed; when unavailable print short fixed classification so owner can paste. **Do not rerun prior static 5-frame test or established old margin0/1 dynamic just because report push failed**. No production QML, Aqua default-off, native Rust, Region or `stable` changes.


## Checkpoint — private original full BOTTOM×1.5 moving quarter dual-raster gate staged (2026-10-02)

- The source-pinned static original FULL same-instance margin0/.25/.5/.75/1 owner result is recorded immediately above. New *separate* stage-only moving gate now favors privately trying **margin0.25** first, while preserving .5 as independent contingency. DO NOT rerun already qualified frozen five-margin images.
- New original unchanged procedural two-companion, two-spring moving 40ms observer source fixture `scripts/aqua-fixtures/paint-moving-bottom-quarter/shell.qml` blob `24d376b8831afd7423a7eb7c5d6513d12595b592`: adapted from owner-PASSED exact original margin0/margin1 source-pinned 32-frame dynamic Qt scene, ONLY changes the private second cradle from 1 to .25 plus private output/marker names; original body state/geometry/observer/PNG sequence retained. Real full 320×300 private BOTTOM×1.5 8 samples×2 phases×2 companions = 32, sequentially exposed in ONE private original Qt process, NOT simultaneous pairs.
- New pure `scripts/aqua-private-dynamic-bottom-quarter-band-model.py` blob `e76cc7b5fbb7cbf9bc6b7998873cf340f45e8571`: same source-pinned alpha threshold24 and bounded host-exterior decoder plus **same-capture** virtual boundary band on central x119..192, rows 221 & 220, >=3 contiguous pixels. Requires m0 exterior-positive AND m0 virtual-band-positive in each spring phase for meaningful matched dynamic comparison. Candidate m025 both-phase joint YES requires every sampled candidate frame zero exterior AND positive abstract band; otherwise report NO, never infer actual panel connection.
- New reviewed-source guard/Qt runner `scripts/aqua-manual-private-moving-bottom-quarter-band.py` blob `540e268248630db8e2900bd39c38670fd5e4122e` recursively inherits trusted exact current dev clean owner-only `aqua-paint-canary.*/repo`, unchanged original source/security/Qt0.3.1 checks, strict real source-mapped+40ms independent spring/phase witnesses, exact 39 ordered stage validation, max 1MiB×32 owned 0600 private PNGs, 48s owned Qt process timeout/kill/reap and SIGINT/SIGTERM cleanup, no production changes. Output categorical m0/m025 exterior+band any/all by spring phase, joint gate; no Git publication, no real image/log/raw coordinates.
- New `scripts/test-aqua-private-moving-bottom-quarter-band-contract.py` blob `47382dc2a3a5fba95f891ad66b1e7ca08a45c47c` has independent fake-only source/geometry/failure/stage/positive+negative 32 synthetic bounded RGBAlpha8 checks, missing baseline exterior or virtual band, missing motion witness, candidate lost virtual band, malformed/extra/unsafe images. **SOURCE-STAGED ONLY, new fake-only contract and real Qt not yet owner executed**.
- NEXT one owner local command: exact trusted clean current `dev` owner-only clone, exact new source pins, run NEW quarter fake-only before ONE explicitly acknowledged original offscreen Qt dynamic margin0-vs-margin0.25 study. Print only allowlisted fixed categorical lines or fixed failure `GATE`; owner paste only those short categories because earlier `REPORT_PUBLISHED=NO`. If m025 candidate fails sampled exterior or virtual band, review separate static-qualified .5 as next dynamic contingency; never automatically retry, never patch production margin/input Region/default-off Aqua or `stable`.


## Checkpoint — quarter moving fake-only fails before Qt: runner path typo corrected (2026-10-02)

- OWNER's first local NEW quarter-dynamic attempt: exact clean `dev SOURCE_SHA=5b889b2b7314cf7eed4852c8873b8a6fe1eaa7d7`, exact Git `SOURCE_PINS=PASS`, then `GATE=QUARTER_BAND_INERT_FAILED` BEFORE launching ANY real Qt. No 32-frame moving margin0/.25 output exists from this attempt. The current source failure reporter returned only a broad category, so it did not report the failing line.
- Subsequent GitHub source inspection independently found a **deterministic fatal defect** in `scripts/test-aqua-private-moving-bottom-quarter-band-contract.py` blob `47382dc2a3a5fba95f891ad66b1e7ca08a45c47c`: test variable `RUNNER` pointed to non-existent `scripts/aqua-manual-private-moving-bottom-quarter.py`, while the actual source-pinned runner is `scripts/aqua-manual-private-moving-bottom-quarter-band.py` blob `540e268248630db8e2900bd39c38670fd5e4122e`. `blob(RUNNER)` therefore necessarily fails with `FileNotFoundError` before synthetic PNG tests. This concrete defect explains an unavoidable fake failure, but the owner's broad category alone cannot rule out additional failures after repair.
- New repaired **fake-only contract** blob `62eb2d37b9259a4f7933888b81cba4d6a7943688`: correct exact runner path, explicit `RUNNER.is_file()` and literal reviewed basename checks BEFORE blob/runpy inspection. All other existing synthetic positive/negative alpha, spring witness, strict ordered-stage and private-file rejection assertions preserved. Independent GitHub source-only check compared all 43 quoted QML contract tokens and 26 quoted runner contract tokens: no missing tokens; two original full companion instances and expected model cases verified. This is source/static inspection only: corrected full Python fake and actual local Qt NOT YET owner executed.
- Next owner action: ONE clean `aqua-paint-canary.*/repo` current dev disposable clone exact new test SHA + unchanged original Qt fixtures/guard/model/runner source pins, run ONLY corrected NEW quarter fake first, STOP on failure, else exactly ONE explicitly opted-in owner-local original FULL offscreen 32-frame m0-vs-m025 two-spring Qt. Never rerun the successful static five-margin fractional test, never assume m025 dynamic joint gate passes. No Git report publication/interactive login, no production QML/Region/default-off Aqua/native Rust edits or `stable` changes.


## Checkpoint — owner-qualified moving quarter: sampled exterior+virtual-band jointly pass (2026-10-02)

- OWNER provided **actual local output only** from the corrected exact clean `dev SOURCE_SHA=b62011815095fd69451da0d15b2a9d2bcc2ddfd7`: `SOURCE_PINS=PASS`, `AQUA_PRIVATE_MOVING_QUARTER_BAND_INERT_PASS`, `GATE=PRIVATE_MOVING_QUARTER_BAND_CLASSIFIED`. These are owner-supplied short category lines, not independently replayed by GitHub/Cloud Bot, and **no raw PNG, real compositor screenshot or Qt log was published**.
- Original FULL BOTTOM×1.5 comparator run in ONE private Qt process had exactly `QT_DYNAMIC_INSET_FRAMES=32` (original M0 and private-original-cradle M025, 8 separate sequential full RGBA8 frames per cohort per original active stretch/release phase); `INDEPENDENT_40MS_QT_MOTION_WITNESSES=YES` and `TWO_INDEPENDENT_SPRINGS_SEQUENTIALLY_CAPTURED=YES`. Original untouched margin0 had `STRETCH_OUTSIDE_HOST=YES`, `RELEASE_OUTSIDE_HOST=YES` and virtual 2-row band `ANY=YES/ALL=YES` in BOTH phases; full original positive controls valid in this exact session.
- PRIVATE M025 produced `STRETCH_OUTSIDE_HOST=NO`, `RELEASE_OUTSIDE_HOST=NO`; SAME-capture abstract central 2-row contact `STRETCH_VIRTUAL_BAND_ANY=YES/ALL=YES` and `RELEASE_VIRTUAL_BAND_ANY=YES/ALL=YES`. `M025_BOTH_PHASES_ALL_SAMPLED_JOINT=YES`, `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`. This QUALIFIES the .25 original cradle private **sampled** alpha/band dual-signal feasibility at BOTTOM×1.5 and is stronger than the prior static margin0/.25/.5 evidence and separate old dynamic margin0/1 exterior-only comparison. NO unsampled extrema, SAME_INSTANT_PIXEL_COMPARISON=NOT_TESTED, VIRTUAL_BAND_NOT_REAL_PANEL=YES, COMPOSITOR_AND_POINTER=UNTESTED.
- DO NOT run another duplicate static Qt or retest moving M025 merely to publish a report. Do NOT run M050 now: it remains a backup if an independent later visual/input gate shows an M025 issue; do NOT change original `AbyssCompanion.qml`, production input Region, default-off or `stable`.
- NEXT distinct blocker: **actual panel/edge visual connection and native pointer/popup integration**, not another abstract offscreen raster loop. Source audit at original `AbyssPerimeter.qml` blob `a3cd2a7bfbdf32dac2c7e42057a1dfaaeea214ac` shows the real BOTTOM companion host is anchored `y = window.height - AbyssStyle.perimeterThickness - implicitHeight + 5` and `scale=root.companionScale`, next to real `AbyssBar`/layershell; original procedural `AbyssCompanion.qml` blob `b5b01835a282458eba0d0268396ae2c350d919d2` keeps its separate original bottom-anchored cradle. The 320×300 private host bottom/virtual 2-row band does **NOT** establish actual position/blending against real AbyssBar geometry/waves, screen clipping or real perception.
- Next engineering task: design and inert-validate a **separate opt-in owner-only Niri-in-Niri** real AbyssBar+original Aqua BOTTOM×1.5 visual A/B using exact source-pinned current production panel and an owner-private QML shadow modifying ONLY disposable `AbyssCompanion` cradle bottomMargin between 0 and .25. One nested output, private XDG/session, positively verified unique nested socket distinct from host; never run candidate on active desktop. Hold visual pose and bar theme/waves identical where feasible; capture only the nested isolated compositor output or inspect privately, and surface fixed safe categorical evidence plus explicit owner visual acceptance of seam/contact and edge clipping. Separately validate nested body hover/click, outside-host pass-through, bar/popup transfer and real input-mask behavior ONLY after visual acceptance and a separately source-pinned pointer review. Any missing unique nested isolation/Wayland capture/visual evidence is UNQUALIFIED; no permissive fallback or production switch. Existing nested Niri and pointer-child patterns can be reused after re-review of exact blobs, but their prior scale1 pointer PASS does NOT qualify M025 at BOTTOM×1.5. Later repeat other edges/scales/multiple outputs and exact-SHA canonical validation before production change.


## Checkpoint — private nested real-panel BOTTOM×1.5 m0/m025 source-shadow and preflight staged (2026-10-02)

- KEEP qualified owner Qt evidence at exact `b62011815095fd69451da0d15b2a9d2bcc2ddfd7`: 32 actual full m0/m025 moving images, two phases, independent 40ms spring/mapped witnesses, m0 original exterior+band positive BOTH phases, m025 exterior NO and abstract 2-row band positive in EVERY 16 sampled m025 frames; `M025_BOTH_PHASES_ALL_SAMPLED_JOINT=YES`. This is sampled virtual raster feasibility ONLY: real AbyssBar/edge visual connection, unsampled extrema, real compositor, click/popup remain unqualified. Do NOT repeat the proven static/dynamic comparisons, do NOT patch production margin or enable Aqua by default.
- Re-audited exact original `AbyssCompanion.qml` blob `b5b01835a282458eba0d0268396ae2c350d919d2` and actual production `AbyssPerimeter.qml` blob `a3cd2a7bfbdf32dac2c7e42057a1dfaaeea214ac`: original separate cradle anchored bottom, actual Aqua BOTTOM native placement depends on actual Abyss panel thickness, output and bar field. Distinct real nested screenshot gate is justified; synthetic 2-row contact alone must never be called real panel connection.
- NEW source-staged INERT `scripts/aqua-private-panel-quarter-shadow.py` blob `90383bc2ad12016d115ce5c61c2d9a4b55551602`: exact ORIGINAL-BLOB-pinned reversible single-line `anchors.bottomMargin: root.edge === "bottom" ? 0.25 : 0` ONLY in private candidate copy of original separate cradle. Original-m0 baseline symlinks original QML in an identically mirrored owner-private modules import tree, preserving genuine production `AbyssPerimeter`/bar and untouched original full Region. Reject wrong owner-only disposable clone layout/permissions, repo-overlap, source drift and preexisting output.
- NEW fake-only contract `scripts/test-aqua-private-panel-quarter-shadow.py` blob `47fa52d1c3c087c165e4d7fc6ac166aca088110a`: synthetic source/perms/reversible baseline vs candidate and fail-closed misuse, plus fake availability checker; has NOT YET been owner-run. NEW read-only availability `scripts/aqua-private-nested-visual-prerequisites.py` blob `83367598877fa61804cdb84ef500fce744fbbb99` checks Niri, Quickshell, D-Bus, Cargo, grim, existing host sockets but never starts guest/captures host. More in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_VISUAL_QUARTER_DESIGN.md`.
- NEXT: exact current-`dev` clean `aqua-paint-canary.*/repo` private clone run ONLY NEW fake plus prerequisite tool availability (fixed flags; no Qt), then implement/review independent opt-in Niri-in-Niri owner-only actual AbyssBar screenshot coordinator with source pinned nested/daemon process ownership, strict distinct nested sockets before ANY guest screenshot, no host screenshot fallback, two sequential same-theme baseline/candidate visual captures kept LOCALLY, fixed categorical cleanup and explicit owner visual seam/cropping assessment; distinct native pointer/popup gate LATER. Never request publishing screenshots or Qt logs/Git authentication. Production Aqua/source/Region, unrelated MegaQML and `stable` unchanged.


## Checkpoint — owner nested screenshot prerequisites PASS; real original-BOTTOM quarter visual runner staged (2026-10-02)

- OWNER provided exact local source SHA \`e3ba26c9a372ed35f02e6aabdb3b1f7a757a2d0b\`: \`SOURCE_PINS=PASS\`, \`AQUA_PRIVATE_NESTED_VISUAL_SHADOW_INERT_PASS\`, Niri/Quickshell/dbus-run-session/Cargo/Grim AND host Wayland+Niri socket availability all YES, \`GATE=VISUAL_PREFLIGHT_SOURCE_ONLY_COMPLETE\`. NESTED_COMPOSITOR_STARTED=NO and SCREENSHOT_ATTEMPTED=NO are explicit; no compositor visual evidence exists yet. Previous owner 32-frame original BOTTOM×1.5 M025 dynamic same-capture exterior and abstract virtual-band accepted; DO NOT repeat those passes.
- Key generator audit correction before live test: original first generator symlinked \`AbyssPerimeter.qml\`, risking resolution of relative companion import from the REAL repository instead of candidate private shadow and therefore an invisible no-op A/B comparison. New exact source-pinned private generator \`scripts/aqua-private-panel-quarter-shadow.py\` blob \`dd62b2b834e86d41856730547bca8ea4d73aaca8\` now COPIES the exact UNCHANGED \`AbyssPerimeter.qml\` blob \`a3cd2a7bfbdf32dac2c7e42057a1dfaaeea214ac\` into EACH private mirrored module tree, and limits private candidate alteration to ONE original cradle bottom-only 0.25 line. Baseline symlinks the exact original \`AbyssCompanion.qml\` blob \`b5b01835a282458eba0d0268396ae2c350d919d2\`. New generator fake-only \`scripts/test-aqua-private-panel-quarter-shadow.py\` blob \`6d7f16d243ab2cc944d9b2436263c4d1bfd91629\` asserts pinned real-perimeter copy and owner-only safety; NOT YET owner-run.
- NEW private opt-in REAL nested screenshot coordinator \`scripts/aqua-manual-private-nested-quarter-visual.py\` blob \`b719f2b0a6c6e0121f9f2c0467f8d4e7a28cfa9f\`: one owned isolated Niri-in-Niri one output fixed verified scale1, isolated fresh XDG, privately built exact real Rust daemon, unchanged real full AbyssBar scene/source QML input Region with BOTTOM×1.5, two SEQUENTIAL separate original baseline and private m025 child instances; fixed identical actual config; validate exact trusted guest ipc+Wayland endpoints distinct from host, niri output/real layer and QML-ready+daemon before every screenshot. Screen-copy ONLY with explicit guest \`WAYLAND_DISPLAY\`+\`NIRI_SOCKET\` and NO inherited \`WAYLAND_SOCKET\`; no host fallback, no cursor injection. Validate bounded 0600 PNG structural CRC, exact guest dimensions, separate private local captures; verified per-phase Qt/layer/private binary cleanup, guest cleanup and host output topology. No Git publishing, release/mask changes or photo sharing. If Grim nested protocol, scaling, Rust or Niri readiness fails, fixed gate unqualified and stop safely.
- NEW fake-only runner test \`scripts/test-aqua-private-nested-quarter-visual.py\` blob \`4993b2dff09cc40d9069e56ff58bef6f239f7148\` exercises synthetic Niri API/output scale, inherited Wayland FD stripping, host-equals-guest denial before any capture, original/private config, PNG safety and source pins, NEVER launches Qt/Grim/Niri. Needs owner execution together with updated generator fake before any REAL nested screenshot. Both staged files reviewed via source/static checks ONLY, NOT actual owner/executor PASS.
- NEXT one owner local command: clean current \`dev\` private 0700 \`aqua-paint-canary.*/repo\` clone; review full old+new exact source pins; run both new fake-only contract tests then explicit ONE owned Niri-in-Niri real-panel visual capture gate. If verified captures ready, owner visually compare retained local \`original_m0.nested.private.png\` vs \`private_bottom_m025.nested.private.png\` for actual Aqua presence, panel seam/contact, physical BOTTOM clipping; owner conveys only qualitative categorical result and never uploads screenshot/logs/credentials/paths. Do not interpret screenshot creation as visually accepted. Later (separate gate ONLY after visual acceptance): real nested click/hover/popup transfer BOTTOM×1.5 m025. Production default Aqua OFF, unmodified original full Region, \`stable\` and unrelated MegaQML unchanged.

## Checkpoint — actual original BOTTOM×1.5 Niri captures PASS; owner visual review REQUIRED (2026-10-02)

- OWNER executed exact `SOURCE_SHA=75b734f1dd8ad3817d55900bf6c264e5e961b020`; both new fake-only contracts PASS; real nested compositor verified ONE output and DISTINCT Niri/Wayland guest endpoints; actual source-pinned unchanged real AbyssBar/Perimeter and original Aqua baseline+private-only original cradle margin0.25 were run sequentially. Owner observed BOTH `ORIGINAL_M0_NESTED_FULL_IMAGE=CAPTURED` and `PRIVATE_BOTTOM_M025_NESTED_FULL_IMAGE=CAPTURED`; `PRODUCTION_MASK_CHANGED=NO`, `GATE=NESTED_PRIVATE_VISUAL_CAPTURES_READY`. Only short categorical owner logs were provided; private images and raw logs have NOT been read or uploaded by Cloud Bot.
- `REAL_PANEL_VISUAL_CONNECTION=OWNER_REVIEW_REQUIRED`: validated guest PNG creation does NOT prove Aqua actually appears, physical bar seam/contact, absence of actual BOTTOM clipping or candidate visual superiority. No same-instant pixel comparison. Have owner inspect the TWO ALREADY-SAVED LOCAL images, classify original and m025 actual visibility, bar seam contact (CONNECTED/GAP/OVERLAP/UNCLEAR), clipping (NONE/CROPPED/UNCLEAR) and pose comparability; ask for only those categories, never ask for private paths, images, screenshots or raw Qt logs. DO NOT rerun successful source-pinned static/dynamic Qt and nested screenshot tests.
- SOURCE REVIEW: old `scripts/aqua-pointer-targets.py` uses SCALE1 112×98 bottom host and (18,3,76,92) body; separate source-pinned private rectangular `scripts/aqua-private-mask-candidate.py` explicitly requires `root.companionScale === 1`. Existing nested pointer runs are NOT qualification for BOTTOM×1.5 m025; old child has no popup transfer acceptance. DO NOT start real pointer injection until owner visual sign-off. NEXT technical candidate after sign-off: independent owner-only clean source-pinned private Niri-in-Niri BOTTOM×1.5 actual target/underlay/click+Rust bridge acceptance then separate hover/bar/popup test, all guest-only exact socket checks, full original input Region unchanged. Hold production changes/default-off/stable and MegaQML parallel work.
- Detailed gate definitions and image-review categories in `docs/AQUA_NESTED_VISUAL_QUARTER_DESIGN.md`.


## Checkpoint — owner rejected PHYSICAL border attachment; private inner FIELD RIM experiment staged (2026-10-02)

- OWNER supplied the TWO previously retained original-m0 and private-m025 Niri screenshots directly; Aqua and AbyssBar are visibly painted, but owner explicitly requires connection to the actual **workspace-facing visible Screen Edge/Panel/Bar surface**, not the outer physical display border. The Aqua point currently runs toward the physical BOTTOM border and the droplet intrudes into Bar module/tray content. Both previously successful real nested captures remain valid for process/renderer evidence, **NOT** for desired geometric/visual acceptance.
- SOURCE ROOT CAUSE reviewed: unchanged \`AbyssPerimeter.qml\` BOTTOM Aqua y uses fixed \`AbyssStyle.perimeterThickness\` instead of existing real per-output, per-edge \`window.nativeInsets\` and \`window.bodyInsets(edge,along,span)\` (the latter includes local \`bar.deformations\`). The real paint is one \`AbyssField\` shader SDF using those insets and wave textures; \`AbyssBar.qml\` is only the foreground modules host. Fixed physical border and actual Bar/Panel inner contour are NOT equivalent.
- NEW owner-private source-only differential pilot: BOTH cases exact original BOTTOM×1.5 Aqua with same PRIVATE original cradle bottomMargin0.25, SAME original full Region, same real AbyssBar and theme. Only candidate's private copied \`AbyssPerimeter\` BOTTOM y switches fixed physical border to a finite \`window.companionFieldDepth()\` at Aqua's actual scaled footprint, derived from \`bodyInsets\` / local Bar deformation. Baseline \`screen_boundary_m025\`, candidate \`inner_field_rim_m025\`. No production files touched; ONLY resting/local field contour, NOT moving wave crests/left/right/top.
- STAGED source-only helper \`scripts/aqua-private-field-rim-attachment.py\` blob \`b7c2ac861ab11073540d113df86a1339c7f43e6e\` and fake-only \`scripts/test-aqua-private-field-rim-attachment.py\` blob \`4ee39c31309869d6b96826b4a6fda070dd0c7992\`; opt-in previously owner-qualified exact guest Niri screenshot runner narrow adaptation \`scripts/aqua-manual-private-field-rim-visual.py\` blob \`61e1da5c6811bfb70c1d442efaad4ef11962eb34\` plus fake-only full reversible source-diff test \`scripts/test-aqua-private-field-rim-visual.py\` blob \`9dd040df3037d37e1fc7d77dba548bea7d254778\`. NONE of these NEW tests or guest snapshots has yet been executed by owner. Pin actual unchanged original Aqua/perimeter, shader QML/source+compiled QSB, layout, bar, surface and style before running. Keep old PASSED alpha/static/32-frame dynamics and first two nested screenshots; do not rerun them.
- NEXT: strict current-\`dev\` owner-only clean disposable clone, run ONLY TWO NEW fake contracts, then one explicitly authorized guest-only visual A/B comparing the two same-m025 anchoring strategies. Review OWNER LOCAL images for actual visible field inner-rim contact, no physical-bottom tip, no clock/tray overlap, no cropping, theme/material seam, separated vs indistinguishable animated poses. This is geometric first-pass, NOT fused material/dynamic wave/four-edge/physical pointer acceptance. If any image gate fails, fix the new private candidate after diagnosis, don't modify production. Keep Aqua default OFF, existing production mask, \`stable\` and unrelated MegaQML unchanged.
- LATER accepted design: fuse Aqua's contact neck into the shared field material using one already allocated SDF or equivalently measured cheap path, let EXISTING wave simulator drive bounded connection response, respect dynamic local depth and editor thickness; place in genuine free segment avoiding \`bar.layoutRecords\`, corner/popup occupancy, honor theme, multi-output, all four edges, hidden/auto-hide and sampled+unsampled motion. Separate native BOTTOM×1.5 pointer/popup gate only after visual acceptance. Full design and exact pins in \`docs/AQUA_NESTED_VISUAL_QUARTER_DESIGN.md\`.


## Checkpoint — owned field-rim A/B source, fake and TWO Niri CAPTURES PASS; owner visual verdict pending (2026-10-02)

- Owner executed exact `SOURCE_SHA=d917826b28ac73a6a372ff419ee7303f8f5d67d1`. Source pins PASS, BOTH NEW field-rim fake-only tests PASS. Guest Niri ONE verified output, DISTINCT sockets, original full Aqua + identical m025 cradle for BOTH geometry cases. Old `SCREEN_BOUNDARY_M025_NESTED_FULL_IMAGE=CAPTURED` and new `INNER_FIELD_RIM_M025_NESTED_FULL_IMAGE=CAPTURED` with `GATE=NESTED_PRIVATE_FIELD_RIM_CAPTURES_READY`, production mask unchanged and two owner-local private images saved/opened. **Capture gate accepted**, dynamic wave, four edges, physical input and REAL PANEL VISUAL CONNECTION still UNTESTED/OWNER_REVIEW_REQUIRED. New actual two images have NOT been inspected by Cloud Bot; older physical-edge owner screenshots cannot represent these captures. NO DUPLICATE RERUN. Ask owner to classify real inner surface seam, cropping and tray/clock overlap from the two already saved images, with only short visual categories, not private paths/logs.
- In parallel, staged safe INERT layout solution `scripts/aqua-private-bar-free-slot.js` blob `342960e0c6d19068732eea805a6c4cc35e055a3e` + Node-only fake behavior contract `scripts/test-aqua-private-bar-free-slot.cjs` blob `abf5cfe2afa48861cb55b19f2a6cecf7b57c2872` (NOT owner-run). Source audit: current Aqua 0.72 position ignores full output-specific `bar.layoutRecords`, so inward contact alone risks overlapping real Bar foreground. Pure interval solver source-safely finds closest actual clear slot from full active module `edge/along/span`, scale1.5 footprint, bounded corner/edge clearance and explicitly qualified future popup reservations; fail closed with no slot. 11 direct in-memory logic probes PASS; 1,200 deterministic fuzz cases with 1,181 qualified/19 rejected, zero static same-edge bbox clearance violations. These are research geometry checks, NOT real Qt/Niri acceptance. Do NOT import new helper into original production or blindly bind `liquid.records` until records' schemas and popup ownership are verified.
- NEXT: owner categorical visual verdict for saved baseline-vs-field-rim images. If new field-rim still misses actual surface, fix private attachment pose, scale transform and cradle seam before integrating slot policy; if visually promising, test private import of slot against live `bar.layoutRecords` with no-space fail-closed, then inspect private Niri results. Organic shader-union neck/theme and bounded existing-wave attachment remain separate; native pointer/popup and 4-edge coverage remain postponed. Existing production QML/Region/Aqua default-off, `stable` and concurrent MegaQML untouched. Details: `docs/AQUA_NESTED_VISUAL_QUARTER_DESIGN.md`.


## Checkpoint — owner-authorized production code on dev, self-test next (2026-10-02)

- Owner explicitly requested IMPLEMENT rather than more private-only
  checkpoints, and will personally test/refine dev. Production
  implementation introduces `AquaSurfacePlacement.js` (reviewed free
  Bar-slot algorithm) and connects current Aqua's four-edge position to
  ACTUAL inner Abyss shader-field depth at the chosen non-overlapping
  `bar.layoutRecords` footprint, not the physical display border.
  Centered item scale is accounted for. No nearby clear slot means Aqua
  hidden; when editor, popup/side panel or utility overlay is open, Aqua
  is hidden until dynamic popup occupancy is reviewed. Original full
  production input Region, default Aqua OFF, existing shader, colors and
  bridge are preserved. Original bottom cradle receives ONLY
  `bottomMargin=0.25`; other edges still retain original cradle.
- Keep historical input material explicitly in two source-exact
  `scripts/aqua-fixtures/historical/*.snapshot` files, and update
  archived fake tests to test the archive rather than demand an old
  SHA from the NEW current production. New
  `scripts/test-aqua-production-surface-slot.cjs` +
  `scripts/test-aqua-production-surface-integration.py` exercise
  production policy/geometry, same old mask/default-off, and 1,200
  deterministic cases against the reviewed private research. Do not
  weaken source-pinned old owner opt-in commands; their pin mismatch
  is expected against new dev. Keep stable, MegaQML and unrelated
  parallel work untouched.
- NEXT owner action: use updated dev checkout, run the focused tests
  and canonical local validator, manually enable Aqua in a dev-loaded
  desktop and report actual four-edge UI/contact/tray overlap and
  color/theme observations. Missing actual visual acceptance must
  NOT be reported as PASS. Iteratively fix direct dev implementation
  as bugs are observed; no further duplicate private screenshot
  boilerplate. Organic SDF/material weld, sampled extreme spring
  motion, actual dynamic local wave following, real popup occupancy
  and scale1.5 physical click/pass-through remain subsequent tasks.


## Checkpoint — managed Visual First bootstrap, exact-SHA production regression PASS (2026-10-02)

- Managed profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2` reconnected via the actual GitHub connector, read `AGENTS.md`, `agent/CONTEXT.md`, this TODO and both worker/local execution READMEs. Current production `modules/abyss/AbyssPerimeter.qml` and `modules/abyss/companion/AquaSurfacePlacement.js` were independently fetched on `dev`: production uses output-specific `bar.layoutRecords`, fail-closed empty-slot handling, real local `bodyInsets` field depth and occlusion guards; the separate original Aqua body retains BOTTOM-only cradle margin 0.25. These are source observations, not visual approval.
- Dispatched owned deterministic read-only job `JOB-AQUA-SURFACE-P1E0042-20261002-01` in commit `540f1b4b0f4a04eb1f44a870fc3033edf17e9025`, first parent/base `e5969e2f6cd3dc92d3e437c682905d8a3254c43c`. Its published `automation/results/JOB-AQUA-SURFACE-P1E0042-20261002-01.json` receipt states status PASSED. All THREE independent actions exited 0 with empty stderr and no timeout: `node scripts/test-aqua-production-surface-slot.cjs` (evidence `JOB-AQUA-SURFACE-P1E0042-20261002-01:0`), `python3 scripts/test-aqua-production-surface-integration.py` (`:1`), and `python3 scripts/test-aqua-production-contract.py` (`:2`). Source SHA on every action is the job commit `540f1b4b0f4a04eb1f44a870fc3033edf17e9025`. This is focused contract coverage only; global canonical and new production visual/compositor input have NOT been accepted.
- Visual-reference BLOCKER: GitHub `fetch_file` on `dev` returned NOT_FOUND for the required `docs/aqua-visual/reference/` location and for `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` / `README.md`. None of the FOUR maintainer originals (Blueprint, Expressions & Emotions, Animations & Transitions, Animation Plus) or their SHA-256 integrity data could be authenticated at the required location. Do NOT generate, silently substitute, or claim verification of these source images. Restore the maintainer's original four files and a provenance/hash manifest in that directory before any image-to-blueprint similarity verdict; code/runtime work may continue independently.
- Most valuable distinct follow-up: restore/validate reference provenance, then obtain new exact-current-production Aqua visual captures (the historical owner-private pre-integration Niri A/B and original-m025 Qt frames do NOT verify the new integrated source), review visible four-edge geometry, actual inner-field seam/cropping and theme adaptivity with maintainer. Keep current default Aqua OFF, production Region untouched; improve procedural body/expressions/organic SDF weld only against new evidence. Pointer/popup transfer, dynamic wave, 4-edge/multi-output performance, global canonical and maintainer acceptance remain separate gates. Do not adopt/reexecute another managed profile's queue jobs.


## Checkpoint — first direct-dev procedural appearance refinement and 4/4 source gate (2026-10-02)

- Distinct Visual First source milestone `9416ffb447d1e3a305464223cb830f572ce459e0` modifies ONLY production `modules/abyss/companion/WaterDropletBody.qml`: four cubic silhouette controls widen the original runtime-painted body without changing its 76×92 external bounds; paired eyes enlarge from 12×16 to 14×18 with a second theme-specular catchlight, and two modest warm procedural cheeks react to pulse. Existing Qt Shape material, theme-based body/pupil/reflection, eye/face signals, local squash/bob/sway, reduced-motion gating and input host stay in place. These are source changes, NOT a claim of matching the absent four original reference images or real-render acceptance.
- Added fail-closed static `scripts/test-aqua-procedural-visual-contract.py` to check outline, paired gaze/blink/catchlights/cheeks, procedural-only asset policy, theme tokens, motion gates, unchanged production host bounds/mask and default-off settings. Source-review corrections to this NEW test are complete at `8dd79a99f9e7ddfc38a142a695f8fb5c4dcd105f`; no unverified failing worker run was repeated.
- Dispatched only THIS profile's fresh `JOB-AQUA-VISUAL-SOURCE-P1E0042-20261002-02`, introduced by `dcb752852fde3745f7168b1c26b61ef6e98a5ef3` with verified first parent/base `8dd79a99f9e7ddfc38a142a695f8fb5c4dcd105f`. Its GitHub-published receipt at `automation/results/JOB-AQUA-VISUAL-SOURCE-P1E0042-20261002-02.json` reports `status=passed`, **4/4 exit 0**, stderr empty, timeout false for evidence IDs `JOB-AQUA-VISUAL-SOURCE-P1E0042-20261002-02:0` (new appearance static), `:1` (production slot), `:2` (production field-rim integration), `:3` (production contract). Exact worker `source_sha=dcb752852fde3745f7168b1c26b61ef6e98a5ef3` on all actions.
- KEEP visual-reference blocker from prior checkpoint: required ORIGINAL `docs/aqua-visual/reference/` and `manifest.json` were NOT_FOUND via GitHub; no verified maintainer originals or hash provenance. The historical owner private Niri/Qt tests qualified earlier code, NOT the new body or field-attachment integration. No current production Qt/Niri frame, 4-edge aesthetic review, pointer/popup acceptance, global canonical PASS, dynamic SDF body weld or subjective visual sign-off is claimed. Keep Aqua OFF by default, leave production input Region/other shell families/stable unchanged. Next: make authentic reference set verifiable and gather a separately SHA-pinned current production isolated visual capture before further major silhouette/material changes, preserving private screenshots and requiring maintainer review.


## Checkpoint — synthetic visual review on latest smoothed dome (2026-10-02)

- Profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2` recovered the completed earlier Aqua receipts; did NOT recapture those cases. Fixed missing PNG RGBA filter-0 support in the retained image inspector after old private evidence classifier isolated the failing line; separate source-pinned recovery `JOB-AQUA-MATRIX-RECOVERY-P1E0042-20261002-09` passed 2/2. A strict four-ROI curator stripped all pixel/metadata outside the synthetic owned-Qt images; the previous and new original privately retained PNGs/logs remain local.
- Cloud Bot **actually opened and compared** [older synthetic QML result](../../docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T165800Z-608cc6/curated-four-pose.png) against the [smoothed-dome result](../../docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T170320Z-3dc5f9/curated-four-pose.png). Earlier observed issues were pointed/lumpy tip, tilted/rotated face on side/bottom, disconnected side cradles. Source changes on dev produced fuller six-curve procedural body with real orientationAngle distinct from sway/lean and counter-rotated upright face, and side-anchored cradles. The second observed patch softened two top shoulder curves without changing host bounds/mask/default-off policy; new top contour appears smoother. Side cradles remain separate strips in a synthetic no-panel fixture. See detailed short review: `docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T170320Z-3dc5f9/review.md` and exact image/provenance there.
- Source `608cc6b5f95b5df7701e3f23ed29d2a44a2be54f`: focused production/source + private Qt capture `JOB-AQUA-VISUAL-FACE-P1E0042-20261002-13` **5/5 exit0**, 1790960276–1790960280; safe publication `JOB-AQUA-CURATED-V2-PUBLISH-P1E0042-20261002-15:0` exit0 at 1790960501. Smoothed source `3dc5f9691164fb8929ba11003fa1b61483dc561b`: source/integration/Qt `JOB-AQUA-SMOOTH-DOME-P1E0042-20261002-16` **3/3 exit0** at 1790960597–1790960600; fake+private provenance+safe-only publication `JOB-AQUA-SMOOTH-CURATE-P1E0042-20261002-17` **3/3 exit0** at 1790960688–1790960693. Only these exact SHA checks and actual published images are accepted; no global canonical claim.
- CRITICAL gates still OPEN: four original maintainer reference images plus `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` absent/unverified; no similarity or maintainer visual acceptance. Synthetic Qt sheet is NOT actual AbyssBar material weld, shader waves, native pointer/popup transfer, clipping extremes, per-edge scales or multi-output acceptance. **NEXT:** authenticate four originals, then build/review separately isolated exact-current-source real Abyss Panel field and native input screenshot gate before tuning cradle/SDF weld based on synthetic guesses. Keep Aqua OFF by default, production Region, stable and concurrent MegaQML untouched.


## Checkpoint — Qt shader-field feasibility and nested render prerequisites (2026-10-03)

- Managed profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2`; checkpoint parent HEAD `ddb08ff2c0fc1e3cae859300acacf50405de6e51`. All NEW work this turn is disposable test source and metadata on `dev`, **no production Aqua shader/body/region/default setting edit**. Last aesthetically reviewed, safely published real-QML FOUR-POSE synthetic body image remains `docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T170320Z-3dc5f9/curated-four-pose.png`, original captured source `3dc5f9691164fb8929ba11003fa1b61483dc561b`. Real actual Abyss field welding, native pointer/popup, original maintainer blueprint similarity and visual approval remain UNQUALIFIED. Verified `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` still NOT_FOUND at checkpoint.
- Source-read verified real field uses `modules/abyss/looks/AbyssField.qml` and tracked `AbyssField.frag.qsb`; full `AbyssPerimeter.qml` binds Aqua field depth using real local `bodyInsets` and module layout. Added `scripts/aqua-fixtures/real-field-canary/shell.qml`, `scripts/aqua-manual-real-field-canary.py` and fake-only contract to stage both actual `AbyssField` and current `AbyssCompanion` on four synthetic fixed-inset edges ONLY under owned Qt offscreen. No host compositor, wallpaper, real modules, desktop screenshot, input or production Region changed. This test has **NOT** passed the real shader image gate: do not publish/use its partial logs or claim current field seam evidence.
- Diagnostic history exact Git worker evidence: `JOB-AQUA-REAL-FIELD-P1E0042-20261003-18:2` source `e6ddb3b542818db3be9a132d6b54b7cd1aa98875`, exit1 at Unix 1790961540, known stdout SHA matched fixed `PRIVATE_LOG_UNQUALIFIED`; corrected owned process umask 0077. `JOB-AQUA-REAL-FIELD-P1E0042-20261003-19:2`, source `d83d1bdce7cf8f59472ea4b18a16e345245faf4e`, exit1 at 1790961660, matched `PRIVATE_CANVAS_INVALID`; split fixed categories, did not replay old jobs. `JOB-AQUA-FIELD-CANVAS-P1E0042-20261003-20:1`, source `139b1c8c4ed261436e0eb903991da1ff7735ef48`, exit1 at 1790961750, exact hash matched `WINDOW_NOT_BACKING`; using eager visible window `JOB-AQUA-FIELD-WINDOW-P1E0042-20261003-21:1` source `ea047cd258776cbf3c0ad9fe7ceffc0457b189d6` still exit1 `WINDOW_NOT_BACKING` at 1790961821.
- New isolated NO-ART diagnostic `scripts/aqua-qt-offscreen-backend-matrix.py` (3 modes, private fixed-category outputs, no pixels or GPU identifiers) `JOB-AQUA-QT-BACKENDS-P1E0042-20261003-22:0,:1` source `39c46ca2f0decb6fba1bbc9175b94681987a479d`, both exit0; second observed 1790961975, exact stdout hash decoded `GATE=BACKEND_MATRIX_D1G0S1`: default and software offscreen create a simple backing window, forced OpenGL does not. This is NOT a general GPU failure conclusion. Alternate actual field probe under Qt-default `JOB-AQUA-FIELD-DEFAULT-P1E0042-20261003-23:1` source `2948f43b525217b5d0a931a05afd90c0aceab5fe`, exit1 Unix 1790962070, fixed `REAL_SHADER_NOT_READY`; NOT a rendered field PASS. After a stale **test-only** first attempt `JOB-AQUA-FIELD-GATE-P1E0042-20261003-24:0` failed without Qt, corrected static assertion, then `JOB-AQUA-FIELD-GATE-P1E0042-20261003-25:0` fake test exit0 and `:1` current actual field exit1 at Unix 1790962221, source `a230d3685da6fa0a6a9ceb13b58b5f15ff819cfe`, exact stdout hash matched `FIELD_GRAPHICS_API_UNSUPPORTED`. In this worker's current Qt-default offscreen context, real shader rendering is blocked; static QSB existence is NOT GPU shader acceptance. None of these failures warrant repeating identical captures.
- Reviewed existing `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-pointer.py` and inert safety contract; it requires explicit opt-in and has real nested/session and Git operations: do NOT invoke it as an arbitrary unattended capture. Instead created `scripts/aqua-nested-render-capability.py` and fake-only tests with no connection to host sockets or any screenshot. `JOB-AQUA-NESTED-PREFLIGHT-P1E0042-20261003-26:0,:1` source `319e91873f4c6f82c88fe9e55ab3b82ea7b102af`, both exit0 at 1790962357, bounded output length/category `NESTED_PREREQUISITES_PRESENT_NOT_ISOLATION_PASS`: local Niri, Quickshell, DBus and owned host socket PATH preconditions are present, **NOT** proof of nested compositor isolation, GPU capability, shader rendering or permission to capture the host desktop.
- NEXT VISUAL FIRST: design independently reviewed **owned isolated Niri-in-Niri shader-field capture** using exact-current-source `AbyssField` and Aqua; require different owned nested Wayland/Niri sockets, host output state unchanged before/after, no host screen capture, private raw frames/logs only, and safe pixel/provenance curating prior to any publication. Verify isolation first, then capture/render/inspect real QSB field seam on left/right/top/bottom before further cradle/material tuning. Authenticate original four maintainer reference files/manifest before any blueprint comparison. Do not touch stable or concurrent MegaQML.


## Checkpoint — verified fresh nested-only isolation smoke (2026-10-03)

- **Protocol evidence repair:** previous turn's immutable worker results were re-fetched, not replayed: `JOB-AQUA-QT-BACKENDS-P1E0042-20261003-22`, `JOB-AQUA-FIELD-GATE-P1E0042-20261003-25`, and `JOB-AQUA-NESTED-PREFLIGHT-P1E0042-20261003-26` are completed receipts for this profile. Their earlier conclusions are repository history; do **not** substitute them for newly supplied local diagnostic evidence. Compare from previous checkpoint `9a5b74b0436336b207ebbf78df31cd28412f843f` to the initial current HEAD `14e81fbe8446d0977d52c6a24030fcbdf24f8e40` showed 10 concurrent automation/MegaQML commits without modifying Aqua's production body or field.
- **New distinct owned job** `JOB-AQUA-NESTED-ISOLATION-P1E0042-20261003-27` introduced in `cc710646b29b47ea639d79e36f58432b4e3f1b65` with first-parent base `350775e3655e5493a044268cf68ae6c7fb4595c7` and resource `shell:inir`; exact private job receipt `automation/results/JOB-AQUA-NESTED-ISOLATION-P1E0042-20261003-27.json` verified `status=passed`, action `:0` inert parser/contract exit0, action `:1` isolation-only runner exit0, both observed Unix `1790964888`, zero stderr, no timeout. The bounded runner returns exit0 **only** for code `NESTED_SOCKET_DISTINCT_HOST_INVARIANT_CLEAN`: owner-private nested IPC and Wayland endpoints distinct from host, exactly one nested active output, nested layer API available, child stopped and complete host Niri outputs response unchanged before/after. No nested Qt render, framebuffer pixels, GPU shader, real Aqua pointer or actual production Panel image verified yet.
- Newly added safety-tested `scripts/aqua-nested-isolation-smoke.py` and `scripts/test-aqua-nested-isolation-smoke-fake-only.py` use a short-lived ordinary-user nested compositor with private logs, fixed public gate only, no desktop screenshot, no Git write or production config/Region change. Older full nested pointer scripts were **not** invoked, replayed or adopted.
- **Next Visual First:** design a separate exact-current-source, owned nested-session capture of **actual** `AbyssField.frag.qsb` plus production `AbyssCompanion.qml` at four edges; requalify new child sockets and host output invariance in the same future capture, first retain all rendered pixels/logs private, validate ROI and provenance, publish only reviewed sanitized synthetic-owned sheet and actually open/review the image. Use left/right field seam evidence before adjusting the cradle. Original four reference images and `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` remain unverified; NO visual acceptance. Do not touch stable, default-off state, input Region or concurrent MegaQML.


## Checkpoint — nested actual-field A/B compact material (2026-10-03)

- Profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2`; authoritative prior checkpoint `ecbdd601e223d39120cf1dc4ef216f27546a8b4d`. Verified GitHub connector/current `dev`, read `AGENTS.md`/worker contract and existing owned isolation receipt before writes. No stable changes or host desktop screenshots; concurrent MegaQML preserved. Original maintainer four visual references and `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` remain GitHub NOT_FOUND: **no reference similarity or visual approval**.
- Added owner-private actual-field Niri-in-Niri capture `scripts/aqua-manual-nested-field-capture.py` and inert tests: fresh nested/host endpoints must differ, one nested output, layers available, host output JSON byte-identical before/after, reviewed production `AbyssField.frag.qsb` and actual `AbyssCompanion.qml` staged in a synthetic four-cell 512×512 QML-only fixture; raw pixels/logs owner-private. `JOB-AQUA-NESTED-FIELD-P1E0042-20261003-28` was **INVALID/never executed** after unrelated MegaQML commit interleaved the job's first parent; do not replay. Distinct job `...29` passed fake/static but failed the actual nested image with exact fixed `SHEET_DIMENSIONS_INVALID` on `:2` Unix 1790965433; changed fixture sheet to explicit 512×512 independent of nested compositor. Distinct `JOB-AQUA-NESTED-FIELD-P1E0042-20261003-30`, job/source `42e67777f7e67c9dc58895d006efef2a2c272e5f`, **3/3 exit0** (Unix 1790965518–5524), qualified private real-QSB four-edge rendered QML sheet; safe curator fake/provenance `...31` **2/2 exit0**, non-force publish `...32:0` exit0 at 1790965761. [Baseline nested real-QSB sheet](../../docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T182524Z-42e677/curated-nested-field-four-edge.png) was actually opened: wide detached bright blue cradles, especially side/bottom.
- First QML cradle anchor hypothesis (side anchors flipped and bottom moved top) source/job `07f92d1182265fd32eb82e065a92ef500b0f7a59`, `JOB-AQUA-CRADLE-CAPTURE-P1E0042-20261003-33:0..4` **5/5 exit0** Unix 1790965948–5953. Safe `...34` 2/2 PASS, `...35:0` published PASS Unix1790966103. [Actual negative A/B](../../docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T183233Z-07f92d/curated-nested-field-four-edge.png) was actually opened: bars moved to opposite sides while still detached, bottom bar very visible. Negative outcome documented in `docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T183233Z-07f92d/review.md`; retained, not deleted.
- Revised actual production `modules/abyss/companion/AbyssCompanion.qml` at commit `18e5d363f9221b515fdbd1b4502063a39895f08e`: restored side anchors to observed rim-facing placement; kept inverted bottom top-anchor; compacted necks 58→28px and used the real shared `AbyssStyle.surface` palette instead of accent blue with dimmer specular outline. Default Aqua OFF, original input Region, procedural body geometry and stable untouched; updated two focused source/integration contracts. Source/job `a5de67680dae51b9dd688e4913af79f77a10d616`, `JOB-AQUA-CRADLE-MATERIAL-P1E0042-20261003-36:0..4` **5/5 exit0** Unix1790966279–6285, including fresh private GPU nested real shader capture. Strict curator `...37:0..1` **2/2 exit0** Unix1790966390–6391; publisher `JOB-AQUA-MATERIAL-PUBLISH-P1E0042-20261003-38:0` exit0 Unix1790966434 source `f1abf0a13f05503f243ef67c92f584c08c8b389c`. [Third actual nested sheet](../../docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T183805Z-a5de67/curated-nested-field-four-edge.png), image digest and `curated-provenance.json` verified and image actually OPENED. Large bright detachable blue strips significantly reduced; **tiny rectangular outline still visible**, not a certified shader SDF union.
- Latest concise visual review `docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T183805Z-a5de67/review.md` explains three images and clear limits: fixture has four 224×224 fixed synthetic insets, performance-tier current-QML shader but NOT actual output layout/bar records/modules/popup/native input. Keep all three curated images as baseline and negative regression evidence.
- **NEXT VISUAL FIRST:** first research/review production `AbyssPerimeter.qml` geometry/module records and build independently bounded owned nested session current-source actual Panel-field+Aqua test with private images and strict host invariant. Do not tune cosmetic cradle or claim weld PASS from synthetic cell alone. Authenticate original four maintainer blueprint images/manifest before direct reference approval. Consider canonical validator as separate owned/sanitized SHA-pinned check for last changed Aqua source.


## Checkpoint — actual Bar borderless side A/B and canonical diagnostic status (2026-10-03)

See `docs/aqua-visual/runs/20261002T190454Z-b04003/checkpoint.md` for exact job/source evidence and all outstanding gates. Latest owner-generated **directly visually reviewed** actual `AbyssBar`/Clock/real-QSB left/right A/B showed the separate neck's thin rectangular border ceased to be conspicuous after the one-property production `border.width: 0` edit, pinned source `b04003e95dcecc53113aa56996bff6db636a8fb1`; focused capture job `...44` 5/5 PASS, curator `...45` 2/2 PASS, publisher `...46` 1/1 PASS. NOT full `AbyssPerimeter`/popup/pointer/reference visual acceptance. Earlier source-pinned broad canonical validator `...40:0` exit1 remains unclassified; read-only classifiers `...47` identified legacy log permissions and `...48` a duplicate exact SHA grammar, not the validator's actual failed test(s). Newly generated validator logs now have private `umask 077`. Safe v3 classifier source and inert tests are staged, but no new job was successfully queued; do not invent `...49` receipt. **NEXT VISUAL FIRST:** bounded owned full production Perimeter on nested output and authentic four reference files. Keep reviewed A/B visual sheets and worker evidence.


## Checkpoint — exact four original assets vs reference manifest (2026-10-03)

Read `docs/aqua-visual/reference/20261003-original-asset-checkpoint.md` before next visual edit. All **four original named assets** now exist in `assets/` and `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` now exists, but its older listed reference names under `docs/aqua-visual/reference/` are absent and its four byte counts do not match the corresponding actual `assets/` images. Read-only source integrity job `JOB-AQUA-REF-INTEGRITY-P1E0042-20261003-50:0` source `483ed202186069c4aa0f02f8296da298f202db18` failed exit1 Unix1790970451; distinct bounded classifier job `JOB-AQUA-REF-DIAG-P1E0042-20261003-51:0` source `07bafcb0d88d3e57d468eab91b5870f56e68e2f8` passed exit0 Unix1790970541, verified fixed output digest establishes **BBBB: four manifest size mismatches**. Do not infer actual SHA-256 digests from Git blob IDs. The connector could not directly open large PNG bytes, so `VISUAL_REVIEW_BLOCKED`. Do not edit the images, repair manifest by guessing, or make another visual renderer change before obtaining verified original pixels and reference SHA; next distinct SHA-pinned metadata/safe preview publication should make exact images reviewable and then support direct blueprint/expression/animation comparison. Existing borderless real-Bar A/B stays the current candidate (NOT owner accepted). No owned job remains pending from this specific verification.


## Aqua visual-first rotation checkpoint — 2026-10-03 (profile-1e0042aca8e24db2)

Read **`docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md`** first in the next managed chat. This complete checkpoint supersedes older *current-state* reference-unavailable wording without erasing the historical evidence. At pre-publish HEAD `35dea3835ba0b64917fd526521881724130af975`, all four named original `assets/Water Droplet Companion*.png` Git blobs exist; the older `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` (blob `ae8411d...`) contains wrong relative names AND byte lengths, so actual SHA-256 and authentic pixel review are pending. Never report missing original assets, do not guess SHA-256 from Git blob IDs. Directly reopened the current reviewed cropped real-Bar borderless left/right run `20261002T190454Z-b04003` and old four-pose synthetic run `20261002T170320Z-3dc5f9`; borderless neck outline improved, tall top tip/true field union/reference resemblance still open, and current multi-frame storyboard/full Perimeter/native input/owner approval are NOT proved. All Aqua pending-path inputs found at audit had result receipts; intended `...49` is absent; no new job in this docs-only rotation. First follow-up: exact-current dev probe, bounded actual 4-original SHA-256/bytes/dimensions inventory and authentic pixel viewing, then reference-aligned current-source capture. Preserve default-off, all run baselines, original assets and private evidence. See checkpoint `REFERENCE_COMPARISON_STATUS` and `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` for precise carryover.


## Checkpoint — fresh rotation re-audit, no new Aqua source (2026-10-03)

Current companion status is tracked in `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md` including its NEW `Rotation re-audit` and final `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP`. After a fresh GitHub probe at prewrite HEAD `87fd93d07fa9448f86c061c2d1ebaf5c228e7394`, all four original named `assets/` PNG blobs remain present but manifest is still legacy (actual SHA-256/dimensions unverified). Directly reopened the historical synthetic four-pose and actual Bar before/after cropped images, not original pixels; only the neck-outline reduction is supported by historical A/B evidence, not full material fusion. All 70 Aqua pending-input filenames have matching result receipts, no new Aqua job dispatched, no original/renderer edit or asset deletion in this rotation. `JOB-AQUA-REF-DIAG-P1E0042-20261003-51:0` (exit0) corroborates recorded wrong manifest lengths; original SHA-256 inventory and authentic blueprint pixel viewing are first next action. Old broad canonical exit1 remains unclassified; default-OFF and full runtime/maintainer acceptance unchanged.

## Checkpoint — PROMPT 3 final connector re-audit / rotate (2026-10-03)

- Profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2`, verified pre-write `dev` HEAD `011dea468a535866aa39ea58679d0cb39d85673c`. **Documentation/checkpoint only; no Aqua source edits, new images, delete, tests or job dispatch**. Full verified matrix and ordered bootstrap: `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md` (new `PROMPT 3 final rotation audit` subsection). Post-publish commit must be refetched and read back, not assumed.
- Four original `assets/Water Droplet Companion{, Expression, Animation, Animation Plus}.png` paths all exist with unchanged tracked blobs. Old `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` schema 1 blob `ae8411dfec3bf35d616ffc6b347517671c6bdf31` remains LEGACY INVALID; actual original SHA-256/dimensions and original pixel comparison NOT VERIFIED. First next step is a distinct owned SHA-pinned read-only four-asset hash+dimensions inventory and safe image reading, then manifest repair and original-aligned current-source TOP/side captures. Do NOT declare missing references, invent hashes or score similarity.
- Reviewed existing real-Bar borderless candidate `20261002T190454Z-b04003` and baseline `20261002T185710Z-f53348` remain historical evidence only: slimmer-visible separate neck border, no proof of SDF fusion/full Perimeter. Old synthetic `20261002T170320Z-3dc5f9` has a tall tapered TOP and detached no-panel cradles. All eight runs/baselines preserved; no maintainer-approved image. Expressions, multi-frame animations, theme and native pointer/popup remain OPEN; Aqua default-OFF.
- Fresh queue/result filenames: **70/70 matching Aqua terminal receipts**, no identified owned outstanding job. Historical `...44:0..4` all exit0 source `b04003e9...`; `...51:0` exit0 source `07bafcb0...` establishes original manifest *length mismatch*; `...40:0` canonical exit1 source `303478ea...` remains unclassified, v3 classifier job `...49` was never issued. Never replay jobs or promote old-source tests. Resume VISUAL REFERENCES → EXPRESSIONS/ANIMATIONS → REMAINING ROADMAP.


## Checkpoint — PROMPT 3 connector audit and rotation (2026-10-03)

Profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2`, prewrite HEAD `3cfb145b6b0c97572cbaa312eddc4aaa6d38ab11`; see `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md` and its LAST `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` for all provenance, remaining six-row `REFERENCE_COMPARISON_STATUS`, source files and exact next action. This GitHub-only checkpoint changed **no** Aqua source/assets/manifest, dispatched **no** job and observed **no** new original pixels. Four canonical original `assets/` PNG Git blobs exist and match prior tree identities; schema-1 manifest is legacy INVALID with incorrect names/lengths, actual original SHA-256/dimensions unavailable. Historic reviewed borderless real-Bar candidate `20261002T190454Z-b04003` remains first to open, not owner-approved; previous thin separate-neck border improved, synthetic TOP remains tall, material fusion, original-aligned face, expressions, multi-frame animation, theme, full Perimeter/native interaction remain unaccepted. 70 Aqua input files have same-name receipts, eight run dirs retained, no identified owned outstanding job. Original manifest integrity job `...50:0` exited 1, classifier `...51:0` exited 0 (four length mismatches), broad canonical `...40:0` exited 1 unclassified; no invented `...49` job. First future step: distinct SHA-pinned read-only actual four-original digest/dimensions and safe pixel access; only after authentication repair manifest and compare source-pinned TOP. Default-OFF; no 100% claim. Refetch final publishing SHA and readback rather than assuming commit succeeded.


## Checkpoint — PROMPT 3 atomic readback-ready visual rotation audit (2026-10-03)

Profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2`; verified pre-write `dev` HEAD `5c46b541a6e7709a0595ced9b322fe8259a76c5e`; details and final ordered bootstrap in `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md`. GitHub audit confirmed four canonical original `assets/Water Droplet Companion*.png` with identical known blob IDs; manifest remains legacy/invalid, real SHA-256/dimensions/original pixels UNVERIFIED. No missing originals. Latest reviewed historical source-pinned borderless real-Bar image `20261002T190454Z-b04003` remains candidate; no new capture or original-asset visual comparison, maintainer approval, multi-frame current animation or full Perimeter proof. 70/70 Aqua input/receipt filenames matched at this audit; no new job dispatched, and the unrelated orphan older `JOB-AQUA-DIAG-005` receipt is not current-profile unfinished work. Original reference failure `JOB-AQUA-REF-INTEGRITY-P1E0042-20261003-50:0` exit1 source `483ed202...`; distinct classifier `...51:0` exit0 source `07bafcb0...` confirms four old-manifest byte mismatches, not new SHA values; canonical `...40:0` exit1 remains unclassified. Preserve eight run dirs, original assets, default-OFF and original Region; no production/stable change. First next-chat bounded new task: safe source-authenticated four-asset SHA-256/byte/PNG-dimension inventory and authentic-pixel review, THEN valid manifest and source-pinned aligned TOP/face comparison; prioritize visual matching before expressions/animations/roadmap. Publishing SHA must be refetched and both docs read back; no completion claim until verified.


## Checkpoint — PROMPT 3 curated-image reinspection and exact path verification (2026-10-03)

At pre-publish `dev` HEAD `81e3545c1c397f3bf1c8e3bff7066a69c8f9a8d2`, GitHub connection and three existing **sanitized** renderer images were directly rechecked; see the added `PROMPT 3 — direct curated-image reinspection and exact path audit` section and final `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` in `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md`. The unchanged originals are tracked but their original pixel bytes/SHA-256 remain unavailable through the connector; manifest remains legacy invalid. Historical side-neck border is less conspicuous; the old synthetic TOP remains comparatively tall. **No fresh actual-original comparison, no new test or source patch.** 70/70 Aqua job inputs have matching receipts and no identified owned outstanding job. First future action: audit existing inventory scripts, then obtain exact original four SHA-256/bytes/dimensions with a distinct owned source-pinned read-only job and safely view genuine pixels before updating the manifest or making new visual fidelity claims. Preserve all eight runs and Aqua default-OFF.

## Checkpoint — current-profile PROMPT 3 handoff/readback gate (2026-10-03)

GitHub connector refetched `dev` at pre-write `f8bd2ce8dd01c1e3d64c1b1b8e82b3c7f947f460` (one intervening non-Aqua CLOUD_STORAGE.md commit since the initial `f26f37d` audit). Directly reopened the historical curated real-Bar borderless/baseline left-right PNGs and synthetic four-pose sheet; verified current tree still contains the four immutable original `assets/` PNGs, same source QML blobs, all eight runs and a legacy/invalid unqualified reference manifest. 70/70 Aqua pending-input JSON names have terminal same-name result paths; private worker state remains uninspected, no new job dispatched. Capture `...44:0..4` exit 0 source `b04003e9...`; bounded digest classifier `...51:0` exit 0 source `07bafcb0...` supports old byte-size mismatches only; canonical `...40:0` exit 1 source `303478ea...` remains unclassified. Historical run's manifest publication/review fields lag its actually present safely curated file and separate review; preserve original evidence. See `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md` latest observed-image addendum and final `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` for SHA-provenance and exact next action. No renderer, asset, manifest, runner, test or runtime acceptance change; Aqua remains default-OFF. First new task after fresh GitHub/receipt audit: distinct SHA-pinned read-only true original SHA-256, byte and PNG dimension inventory, safe original-pixel review, and only then manifest correction and current-source aligned TOP capture. Verify publishing commit and both docs by a post-write refetch; do not assume success from this text.

Profile `profile-1e0042aca8e24db2`, prewrite `dev` HEAD `264d666f6bdc38ddd98c8c91e7e501c307358cf6`. Read the MOST RECENT `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` in `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md` after refetching. Docs-only: directly reopened historic curated real-Bar borderless and old with-border A/B plus synthetic four poses, not authentic original pixels; side neck outline less visible, old synthetic TOP still tall. All four true immutable `assets/Water Droplet Companion*.png` Git blobs still exist; current reference manifest old and unqualified, measured original SHA-256/PNG dimensions and reference-pixel view next. Queue/results 70/70 Aqua input/receipt names, no identified new published pending or indeterminate Aqua job; old canonical exit1 unclassified. No new Aqua source changes, job, captures, deletion or maintainer acceptance. First new step: distinct SHA-pinned read-only authentic four-asset inventory and safe pixel review, then reference-matched current render. Preserve all eight runs and default-OFF.

Documentation-only exact-source rotation handoff: read **`docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md` LAST `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` and `REFERENCE_COMPARISON_STATUS`** before any new action. Verified four actual unchanged original `assets/Water Droplet Companion*.png` Git blobs; current schema1 manifest `ae8411dfec3bf35d616ffc6b347517671c6bdf31` remains legacy INVALID, actual SHA-256/PNG dimensions and authentic pixels unknown (not missing reference files). Current historical candidate `20261002T190454Z-b04003` is only a reviewed nested-Niri actual-Bar left/right crop at source `b04003e95dcecc53113aa56996bff6db636a8fb1`; before/after neck border visibility improved, but original TOP/face/glass reference match, SDF weld, complete expressions, storyboard multi-frame, theme changes and actual full Perimeter/native interactions remain NOT ACCEPTED. Eight visual runs retained, zero owner-approved, no new screenshot/source/manifest/assets changes. This fresh tree showed 70/70 Aqua pending-input/terminal-result pairings (one historical result-only orphan), no identified published unmatched owned job; missing `...49` is NOT pending. Historic `...50:0` exit1 at Unix1790970451 and `...51:0` exit0 at Unix1790970541 support a previously documented four-length mismatch; canonical `...40:0` exit1 Unix1790968005 still has unclassified actual failing test. All old test evidence is source-pinned and not new-HEAD acceptance. First NEW work after refetch and receipts/worker contract: a distinct safe four-asset SHA-256/bytes/dimensions inventory and authentic pixel viewing, only then manifest correction and same-source TOP/face/material visual capture. Maintain Aqua default-OFF and VISUAL REFERENCES → EXPRESSIONS/ANIMATIONS → ROADMAP.

Read `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md` **LAST** `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` and `REFERENCE_COMPARISON_STATUS` for full current source/evidence-scoped handoff. Four tracked immutable original assets exist with same blobs; reference manifest remains legacy schema1 INVALID (real SHA-256/dimensions and actual original pixel comparison still missing). Latest historically reviewed borderless nested real-Bar candidate `20261002T190454Z-b04003` at source `b04003e95dcecc53113aa56996bff6db636a8fb1` has a less conspicuous neck border in before/after review; this rotation did NOT open pixels anew or make source/runtime changes. Original-aligned TOP/face/glass matching, SDF weld, full Perimeter, expressions/multi-frame, theme and native interaction all not accepted. 70/70 matching published Aqua input/result filenames, no identified outstanding published owned input; private ledger uninspected. Old `...50:0` exit1, bounded `...51:0` exit0 classifies four old-manifest byte mismatches only; canonical `...40:0` exit1 cause unclassified. No newly dispatched job/test; no current HEAD runtime certification. All eight runs retained, Aqua default-OFF.

Borderless after image has less noticeable separate neck rectangle; old synthetic TOP remains much taller than BOTTOM and its separate blue bars are NOT current actual-Bar proof. No authentic original pixels viewed, no original-relative likeness conclusion. Four actual original assets persist, old reference manifest schema1 blob `ae8411df...` invalid; actual SHA-256 and image dimensions unavailable. GitHub published Aqua inputs/receipts 70/70 matched, no identified unmatched owned published job; private ledger unknown, `...49` never published. No new job, new current-head test, fresh capture, renderer patch, asset change or deletion. Last canonical exit1 remains unclassified; Aqua default OFF and original Region unmodified. **START NEXT:** read latest `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` and comparison table in `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md`; run distinct safe source-pinned real four-original digest/PNG dimensions and actual pixel review, then manifest correction and present-source aligned TOP/face capture.

Read **LAST** `NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP` and `REFERENCE_COMPARISON_STATUS` in `docs/aqua-visual/20261003-visual-rotation-checkpoint.md`. This rotation directly reopened three exact GitHub-published sanitized historical images: borderless nested real Bar `20261002T190454Z-b04003` (source `b04003e9...`), with-border regression `20261002T185710Z-f53348` and synthetic Qt four orientations `20261002T170320Z-3dc5f9`. Borderless side-neck outline is less prominent in actual Bar A/B; old TOP remains tall vs BOTTOM. **Not authentic original-relative proof.** Four unchanged genuine original `assets/` PNGs exist, but manifest schema1 `ae8411df...` has obsolete names/sizes; connector returned zero original PNG content, so authentic SHA-256/IHDR and original pixel assessment still OPEN. Current-source QML unchanged, no fresh validator, capture, job or owner approval. GitHub directories freshly confirm 70/70 Aqua input/receipt names (+one old result-only orphan), no identified published unmatched owned Aqua job; private ledger unknown. Old canonical `...40:0` exit1 unclassified, integrity `...50:0` exit1 and bounded mismatch classifier `...51:0` exit0. **NEXT:** fresh source SHA/receipts; NEW safe four-original exact SHA256/byte/IHDR and genuine pixel review, then manifest correction and present-source aligned TOP/face capture. No historic jobs replay, deletions or Aqua default-OFF changes. Verify publishing SHA before claiming completed rotation.

Directly reopened current published historical borderless real-Bar crop, with-border baseline and synthetic Qt four-pose; smaller visible neck-border stroke is A/B supported, old TOP too tall relative to old BOTTOM is intra-render observed, but NO authenticated-original comparison/current-source PASS. Four actual original `assets/Water Droplet Companion*.png` Git blobs unchanged; manifest schema-1 blob `ae8411dfec3bf35d616ffc6b347517671c6bdf31` invalid old names/sizes, real SHA256/IHDR and original pixels not obtained. Rechecked six receipts; Aqua queue/result filenames 70/70 matched, no new owned job, private ledger unknown; old canonical `...40` exit1 remains unclassified. No Aqua source/assets/manifest edit, current-HEAD tests, new captures, cleanup or acceptance. Preserve all eight runs, default-OFF and native input safety. **Next new step** after branch/receipt re-audit: a distinct owned SHA-pinned READ-ONLY four-original exact digest/bytes/IHDR inventory and safe genuine reference pixel viewing; only then correct manifest and capture current-source reference-matched front/TOP/face. Visual-first → expressions/animations → roadmap.

Genuine original pixels were NOT obtained; four exact original assets persist with unchanged verified Git blobs. Manifest schema1 ae8411dfec3bf35d616ffc6b347517671c6bdf31 remains LEGACY_INVALID; no measured SHA-256/IHDR.

Old canonical ...40 exit1 cause unclassified, old size-integrity ...50 exit1/diagnostic ...51 exit0, no replay. Preserve eight visual runs, originals, default OFF, native input and stable. Next distinct source-pinned read-only four-original true-digest/IHDR inventory with genuine pixel view, then manifest correction and matched current-source TOP/front/material GPU screenshot; only then expressions/animation/roadmap. This checkpoint must be verified by post-publication GitHub refetch before ROTATE.

Same-profile rotation directly reopened real-Bar b04003 vs f53348 and old Qt 3dc5f9 historical sanitized images: borderless neck strokes visibly reduced, old Qt TOP taller/pointier than BOTTOM. No ORIGINAL image pixels were obtained; all four actual immutable `assets/` PNGs verified with unchanged Git blobs; current schema1 manifest `ae8411dfec3bf35d616ffc6b347517671c6bdf31` LEGACY_INVALID and genuine SHA-256/IHDR missing.

No Aqua runtime/manifest edit, job, test, capture, deletion, deploy or owner acceptance this rotation; Aqua DEFAULT-OFF. Next chat first verify postpublication HEAD/TODO/checkpoint/receipts, dispatch distinct safe owned current-SHA READ-ONLY authentic four-original digest/IHDR inventory and arrange real original pixel viewing; then fix manifest and capture same-source TOP/front/3/4 before one visual change.

Public Git queue previously had 70/70 Aqua pairs; private ledger was unavailable to GitHub. **AWAIT THIS OWN JOB RECEIPT FIRST; do not re-dispatch or claim successful measurement before observing outcome.** Git result intentionally contains only bounded metadata hashes, not the private stdout payload; a trusted authorized evidence channel is needed to obtain actual digests before Cloud Bot repairs `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json`. Previous b04003/f53348/3dc5f9 pictures are old source and not reference matched. Do not modify Aqua renderer until genuine board pixels become inspectable. Retain default-off, all eight runs and the unchanged original assets. **VISUAL REFERENCE MATCHING → EXPRESSIONS & ANIMATIONS → REMAINING ROADMAP.**


## PROMPT3-20261003-RECEIPT52-VERIFIED-ATOMIC-HANDOFF — latest receipt-reconciled Prompt 3 pointer

Verified prepublication `dev` `6213d5bf2ea46044ac1385b49e6cdb150c6098c2`. Owned read-only original-metadata job `JOB-AQUA-ORIGINAL-PNG-METADATA-P1E0042-20261003-52` terminal **PASSED**: `...52:0` source `d1f1231790bd8d683cced6bd52bcc966cc95b75b`, Unix 1790984126, exit0, private stdout unavailable through GitHub. All four immutable ORIGINAL asset Git blobs present; original visual pixels/SHA256 JSON values are NOT yet visible to Cloud Bot; legacy schema1 reference manifest remains INVALID/UNMODIFIED. Three old curated renderer PNGs b04003/f53348/3dc5f9 visually reopened; only external cradle-border reduction A/B-proven. Current key renderer blobs match b04003 but no new current GPU test, no maintainer approval. Published Aqua pairs 71/71, result-only DIAG-005; owner-private ledger UNKNOWN; -52 must NEVER repeat. Preserve eight runs, Aqua DEFAULT OFF and native Region. **FULL six-row REFERENCE_COMPARISON_STATUS and TEN-STEP NEXT_CHAT_BOOTSTRAP**: [receipt-reconciled standalone checkpoint](../../docs/aqua-visual/20261003-prompt3-receipt52-verified-handoff.md). FIRST NEXT: refetch HEAD and private ledger, retrieve existing -52 safely sanitized metadata and ORIGINAL pixels, repair authentic manifest only from measurements, then equal-scale current-SHA GPU blueprint comparison.

## AQUA-ORIGINAL-METADATA-PROJECTION-PREP-53 — new distinct read-only existing-receipt bridge

At verified PREPUBLICATION dev b759c369745353094cd1b9e1e67c2894ce699ce8, historical same-profile -52 is TERMINAL PASS (source d1f123..., Unix 1790984126, :0 exit0); its private stdout digest was validated by its receipt but actual four values cannot be inferred. New **distinct** owned job `JOB-AQUA-ORIGINAL-METADATA-PROJECTION-P1E0042-20261003-53` (exact parent base b759c369745353094cd1b9e1e67c2894ce699ce8) only parses the newly authored deterministic source and READ-ONLY validates old -52 private ledger + digest + original four tracked bytes/PNG IHDR; no original assets, renderer, manifest, desktop or public artifacts changed. **Do not rerun -52. Await receipt for -53 first.** If qualified, a separate reviewed publish-only job may expose only source-derived SHA-256/dimensions via `docs/aqua-visual/reference/source-metadata.json`, then Cloud Bot can repair genuine manifest using GitHub. See [safe prep checkpoint](../../docs/aqua-visual/reference/20261003-metadata-projection-prep.md). Original pixels and current-SHA matched GPU frame review remain BLOCKED pending authorized reference access, no maintainer acceptance. Preserve all eight runs/Aqua DEFAULT OFF.

## AQUA-ORIGINAL-METADATA-PUBLISH-P1E0042-20261003-54 — strict publication queued

At independently refetched PREPUBLICATION dev `c38ea8dd9b3669541efe9f67a12d3130f1b0f25d`, same-profile -53 receipt is TERMINAL PASS, two actions `:0/:1` exit0 at Unix `1790985136`, source `d146a1626dabcc4677394c17e598863e11586541`; old source-byte-only -52 already terminal PASS, do not reexecute either. Distinct owner-profile, exact-parent-SHA **single publish-only action** `JOB-AQUA-ORIGINAL-METADATA-PUBLISH-P1E0042-20261003-54` queued to publish verified four-original source metadata (only SHA-256/dimensions/identity/provenance, no private raw stdout, desktop images or original pixel output). Script checks private -52 receipt digest against source bytes, original Git blobs and per-image SHA-256, refetches dev and non-force pushes one JSON file; subsequent worker receipt must be inspected separately. See [atomic queue checkpoint](../../docs/aqua-visual/reference/20261003-metadata-publication-queued.md). **NEXT WAIT -54; do not repeat -52/-53 or retry indeterminate push; inspect GitHub side-effects and receipt first.** Legacy reference manifest unchanged/INVALID, original pixels not viewed, eight runs retained, Aqua default-off. VISUAL REFERENCE MATCHING → EXPRESSIONS & ANIMATIONS → REMAINING ROADMAP.

## AQUA-ORIGINAL-SCHEMA2-MANIFEST-VALIDATION-55 — authentic four-source mapping written

At PREPUBLICATION `dev` `8c77ad20dd13c416918dee7d070fb0645cfaf651`, separate same-profile -54 completed successfully (source `c06718fcf9f5eb9bcdebf11225d65af2bfc6bfbb`, `:0` exit0 Unix `1790985301`), and GitHub now independently exposes exact four original SHA-256/dimensions in `docs/aqua-visual/reference/source-metadata.json` (blob `fec6a62bce75e6892fc3ca8265982197e1d73c97`, `reference_version=authentic-assets-sha256-936258b4e5cffbb1`). This atomic commit maps current `docs/aqua-visual/reference/manifest.json` schema2 to **actual four `assets/` originals** with real Git blobs, SHA-256, bytes, IHDR and source provenance. New precise original-integrity source test and schema2-safe bounded diagnostic, plus reference README and checkpoint. Separate new unique owned parent-pinned `JOB-AQUA-REF-MANIFEST-VALIDATE-P1E0042-20261003-55` tests changed manifest on exact new SHA; **WAIT for -55 receipt; never infer PASS before reading it**. Original PNGs untouched; original PIXELS still not inspected; no renderer code/visual run changed or maintainer acceptance. Keep all eight runs and Aqua default-off; next safely curate genuine source-only preview to enable actual reference comparison, then match present-SHA GPU.

## AQUA-AUTHENTIC-ORIGINAL-PREVIEW-PREP-56 — new noncanonical safe source previews

Refetched PREPUBLICATION `dev` `b07cbf4f6e053820ea1df3ff46b8d1c7aeee396e`; changed schema2 manifest version `authentic-assets-sha256-936258b4e5cffbb1` passed exact-source owned -55 job, actions `:0/:1/:2` exit0 at Unix `1790985447`, test source `2b86f3b9ae9224719d811f762cad8a13fda65a61`. Direct original 1.9–2.2 MB pixels remain unavailable to this ChatGPT surface, not missing in Git. New unique owned exact-parent-SHA prep `JOB-AQUA-ORIGINAL-PREVIEW-PREP-P1E0042-20261003-56` tests a source-only strict PNG RGB8+filter decoder on FAKE pixels, then safely prepares in-memory 512px overview images derived solely from true verified four `assets/` originals; does not modify assets, screenshot host, publish thumbnails or push Git. **WAIT for -56 receipt.** If PASS, distinct publication job after source/receipt review; then directly open genuine-derived previews and compare matched renderer pixels. Overview sampling never supersedes full-res originals, and source integrity isn't visual acceptance. Preserve all eight historical runs, default-off and all native gates.

## AQUA-ORIGINAL-PREVIEW-PUBLISH-57 — separate source-only derivative publication queued

Refetched PREPUBLICATION `dev` `9ccee60ea47683f74c827d2ec22c97150bcde090`, valid authentic reference version `authentic-assets-sha256-936258b4e5cffbb1`. Distinct profile-owned -56 **PASSED** at source `8f5e294e379d79e5b7bbbd6e6230340656cb768c`, `:0` fake RGB/PNG test exit0 Unix 1790985609 and `:1` four real-source in-memory preview prep exit0 Unix 1790985616. New unique `JOB-AQUA-ORIGINAL-PREVIEW-PUBLISH-P1E0042-20261003-57` pinned to first parent `9ccee60ea47683f74c827d2ec22c97150bcde090` requests only separately audited non-force Git publication of four **512px actual-original pixel-derived noncanonical previews** with provenance under `docs/aqua-visual/reference/previews/`, no private desktop pixels, raw stdout, original asset modifications or runtime change. **WAIT for -57 receipt and independently verify published Git files before opening images.** [Publication checkpoint](../../docs/aqua-visual/reference/20261003-preview-publication-queued.md). If visual pixels become inspectable, compare actual original blueprint, expressions and both animation boards to safe renderer outputs and select first real silhouette/material mismatch. Never claim 512px preview resolves unavailable original details or production visual acceptance. Keep eight runs and Aqua DEFAULT OFF.
